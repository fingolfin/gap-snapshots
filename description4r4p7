   4.4 Update 7 (March 2006)

  New or improved functionality

    1. The Display functionality for character tables has been extended by
       addition of an option to show power maps and centralizer orders in a
       format similar to that used in the ATLAS. Furthermore the options
       handling is now hierarchical, in order to admit more flexible
       overloading.
    2. For the function LowIndexSubgroupsFpGroup, there is now an iterator
       variant LowIndexSubgroupsFpGroupIterator. [Suggested (and based on
       code contributed) by Michael Hartley]
    3. Semigroup functionality in GAP has been improved and extended. Green's
       relations are now stored differently, making the system more amenable
       to new methods for computing these relations in special cases. It is
       now possible to calculate Green's classes etc. without computing the
       entire semigroup or necessarily loading the package MONOID.
       Furthermore, the Froidure-Pin algorithm has now been implemented in
       GAP.
    4. Functionality for creating free products of any list of groups for
       which a finite presentation can be determined had been added. This
       function returns a finitely presented group. This functionality
       includes the Embedding operation. As an application of this new code a
       specialized direct product operation has been added for finitely
       presented groups which returns a finitely presented group. This
       application includes Embedding and Projection functionality.
    5. Some new Straight Line Program (SLP) functionality has been added. The
       new functions take given SLPs and create new ones by restricting to a
       subset of the results, or to an intermediate result or by calculating
       the product of the results of two SLPs.
    6. New code has been added to allow group elements with memory; that is,
       they store automatically how they were derived from some given set of
       generators. Note that there is not yet documentation for this
       functionality, but some packages already use it.
    7. New code has been added to handle matrices and vectors in such a way
       that they do not change their representation in a generic manner.
    8. The Irr method for p-solvable p-modular Brauer tables now keeps the
       order of the irreducibles in the ordinary table.
    9. GAP can now handle any finite field for which the Conway polynomial is
       known or can be computed.
   10. New Conway polynomials provided by John Bray and Kate Minola have been
       added.
   11. The ReadTest methods for strings (filenames) and streams now
       automatically set the screen width (see SizeScreen) to 80 before the
       tests, and reset it afterwards.
   12. Now a few more checks are done during the configure phase of compiling
       for future use of some I/O functions of the C-library in a package.
       Also the path to the GAP binaries for the GAP compiler is now handled
       via autoconf. Finally, now autoconf version 2.59 is used.

  Fixed bugs which could produce wrong results

    1. Some technical errors in the functions for compressed vectors and
       matrices which could lead to corruption of internal data structures
       and so to crashes or conceivably to wrong results. [Reported by Roman
       Schmied]
    2. A potential problem in the generic method for the undocumented
       operation DirectFactorsOfGroup: It was silently assumed that
       NormalSubgroups delivers the trivial subgroup as first and the whole
       group as last entry of the resulting list.
    3. The code for sublists of compressed vectors created by vec{range} may
       write one byte beyond the space allocated for the new vector,
       overwriting part of the next object in the workspace. Thanks to Jack
       Schmidt for narrowing down the problem.
    4. Given a class function object of value zero, an InverseOp method for a
       class function erroneously did not return fail. [Reported by Jack
       Schmidt]
    5. The Order method for a class function erroneously returned a finite
       number if one of the values was nonreal, not a cyclotomic integer, and
       had norm 1.
    6. Two missing perfect groups were added, and the permutation degree
       lowered on the perfect groups with the largest degrees. [Reported by
       Jack Schmidt]
    7. When a character table was displayed with Display, the centralizer
       order displayed for the first class shown was not correct if it did
       not involve all prime divisors of the group. [Reported by Jack
       Schmidt]
    8. The first argument of the function VectorSpace must be a field. This
       is checked from now on. [Reported by Laurent Bartholdi]
    9. Up to now, it was possible to create a group object from a semigroup
       of cyclotomics using AsGroup, although groups of cyclotomics are not
       admissible. [Reported by Alexander Konovalov]
   10. The documentation of CharacteristicPolynomial(F,mat) was ambiguous if
       FieldOfMatrix(mat) =< F < DefaultFieldOfMatrix(mat). In particular,
       the result was representation dependent. This was fixed by introducing
       a second field which specifies the vector space which mat acts upon.
       [Reported by Jack Schmidt]
   11. AssociatedReesMatrixSemigroupOfDClass produced an incorrect sandwich
       matrix for the semigroup created. This matrix is an attribute set when
       creating the Rees matrix semigroup but is not used for creating the
       semigroup. The incorrect result was returned when SandwichMatrix was
       called. [Reported by Nelson Silva and Joao Araujo]
   12. The literal "compiled" was given an incorrect length. The kernel was
       then unable to find compiled library code as the search path was
       incorrect. Also the documentation example had an error in the path
       used to invoke the gac compiler.
   13. The twisting group in a generic wreath product might have had
       intransitive action. [Reported by Laurent Bartholdi]
   14. There was an arithmetic bug in the polynomial reduction code.

  Fixed bugs which could lead to crashes

     * Bug 1 in the list of fixed bugs which could lead to wrong results
       could also potentially lead to crashes.

  Other fixed bugs

    1. The matrices of invariant forms stored as values of the attributes
       InvariantBilinearForm, InvariantQuadraticForm, and
       InvariantSesquilinearForm, for matrix groups over finite fields, are
       now in the (compressed) format returned by ImmutableMatrix.
    2. String now returns an immutable string, by making a copy before
       changing the argument.
    3. Permutation ^0 and permutation ^1 were not handled with special code
       in the kernel, hence were very slow for big permutations. [Reported by
       Max Neunhoeffer]
    4. Added code to cache the induced pcgs for an arbitrary parent pcgs.
       (This code was formerly part of the CRISP package.)
    5. This fix consists of numerous changes to improve support for direct
       products, including: - new methods for PcgsElementaryAbelianSeries,
       PcgsChiefSeries, ExponentsOfPcElement, DepthOfPcElement for direct
       products - fixed EnumeratorOfPcgs to test for membership first - new
       methods for membership test in groups which have an induced pcgs -
       added GroupOfPcgs attribute to pcgs in various methods - fixed
       declarations of PcgsElementaryAbelianSeries, PcgsChiefSeries (the
       declared argument was a pcgs, not a group) [Reported by Roman Schmied]
    6. Corrected a term ordering problem encountered by the basis
       construction code for finite dimensional vector spaces of multivariate
       rational functions. [Reported by Jan Draisma]
    7. When the factor of a finite dimensional group ring by an ideal was
       formed, a method intended for free algebras modulo relations was used,
       and the returned factor algebra could be used for (almost) nothing.
       [Reported by Heiko Dietrich]
    8. Up to now, PowerMap ran into an error when one asked for the n-th
       power map where n was not a small integer. This happened in some GAP
       library functions if the exponent of the character table in question
       was not a small integer.
    9. Up to now, the test whether a finite field element was contained in a
       group of finite field elements ran into an error if the element was
       not in the field generated by the group elements. [Reported by Heiko
       Dietrich]
   10. Conjugacy classes of natural (special) linear groups are now always
       returned with trivial class first.
   11. Up to now, it could happen that CheckFixedPoints reduced an entry in
       its second argument to a list containing only one integer but did not
       replace the list by that integer; according to the conventions, this
       replacement should be done.
   12. The functions PrintTo and AppendTo did not work correctly for streams.
       [Reported by Marco Costantini]
   13. The function Basis did not return a value when it was called with the
       argument Rationals. [Reported by Klaus Lux]
   14. For certain matrix groups, the function StructureDescription raised an
       error message. The reason for this was that a trivial method for
       IsGeneralLinearGroup for matrix groups in lib/grpmat.gi which is
       ranked higher than the nontrivial method for generic groups in
       lib/grpnames.gi called the operation IsNaturalGL, for which there was
       no nontrivial method available. [Reported by Nilo de Roock]
   15. Action on sets of length 1 was not correctly handled. [Reported by
       Mathieu Dutour]
   16. Now WriteByte admits writing zero characters to all streams. [Reported
       by Marco Costantini]
   17. The conjugacy test for subgroups tests for elementary abelian regular
       normal subgroup (EARNS) conjugacy. The fix will catch this in the case
       that the second group has no EARNS. [Reported by Andrew Johnson]
   18. So far, the UNIX installation didn't result in a correct gap.sh if the
       installation path contained space characters. Now it should handle
       this case correctly, as well as other unusual characters in path names
       (except for double quotes).
