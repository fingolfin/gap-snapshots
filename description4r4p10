GAP 4.4 Update 10 (October 2007)

  New or improved functionality

 1. Files in the 'cnf' directory of the GAP
    distribution are now archived as binary files. Now
    GAP can be installed with UNIX or with WINDOWS
    style line breaks on any system and should work
    without problems.
 2. Since large finite fields are available, some
    restrictions in the code for computing irreducible
    modules over finite fields are no longer
    necessary. (They had been introduced in order to
    give better error messages.)
 3. Made PositionSublist faster in case the search
    string does not contain repetitive patterns.
 4. The function MakeImmutable now returns its
    argument.
 5. Dynamically loaded modules now work on Mac OS X.
    As a consequence, this allows to work with the
    Browse, EDIM and IO packages on Mac OS X.
 6. Introduced ViewObj and PrintObj methods for
    algebraic number fields. Made them applicable to
    AlgebraicExtension by adding the property
    IsNumberField in the infinite field case.
 7. The function CharacterTableRegular is
    documented now.
 8. The function ScalarProduct now accepts also
    Brauer characters as arguments.
 9. The function QuaternionAlgebra now accepts
    also a list of field elements instead of a field.
    Also, now the comparison of return values (w.r.t.
    equality, containment) yields true if the
    parameters coincide and the ground fields fit.
10. The function RemoveCharacters is now
    documented.
11. Lists in GAP sometimes occupy memory for possible
    additional entries. Now plain lists and strings
    read by GAP and the lists returned by List
    only occupy the memory they really need. For more
    details see the documentation of the new function
    EmptyPlist.
12. There are some new Conway polynomials in
    characteristic 2 and 3 provided by Kate Minola.
13. A new operation MemoryUsage determines the memory
    usage in bytes of an object and all its
    subobjects. It does not consider families and
    types but handles arbitrary self-referential
    structures of objects.

  Fixed bugs which could produce wrong results

 1. When forming the semidirect product of a matrix
    group with a vector space over a non-prime field
    the embedding of the vector space gave a wrong
    result. [Reported by anvita21]
 2. DefaultRing failed for constant polynomials over
    nonprime fields. [Reported by Stefan Kohl]
 3. The method in ffeconway.gi that gets coefficients
    WRT to the canonical basis of the field from the
    representation is only correct if the basis is
    over the prime field. Added a TryNextMethod if
    this is not the case. [Reported by Alla Detinko]
 4. Creating a large (>2^16) field over a non-prime
    subfield went completely wrong. [Reported by Jack
    Schmidt, from Alla Detinko]
 5. A method for Coefficients for Conway polynomial
    FFEs didn't check that the basis provided was the
    canonical basis of the RIGHT field. [Reported by
    BE]
 6. An elementary abelian series was calculated
    wrongly. [Reported by N. Sieben]
 7. Orbits on sets of transformations failed.
 8. Wrong methods for GeneratorsOfRing and
    GeneratorsOfRingWithOne have been removed.
    These methods were based on the assumption that
    one can obtain a set of ring generators by taking
    the union of a known set of field generators, the
    set of the inverses of these field generators
    and {1}.
 9. The name of a group of order 117600 and degree 50
    was incorrect in the Primitive Permutation
    Groups library. In particular, a group was wrongly
    labelled as PGL(2, 49).
10. There was a possible error in
    `SubgroupsSolvableGroup' when computing subgroups
    within a subgroup.
11. An error in 2-Cohomology computation for pc groups
    was fixed.
12. `IsConjugate' used normality in a wrong supergroup

  Fixed bugs which could lead to crashes

 1. GAP crashed when the PATH environment variable was
    not set. [Reported by Robert F. Morse]
 2. GAP could crash when started with option -x 1. Now
    the number of columns is initialized with at
    least 2. [Reported by Robert F. Morse]
 3. After loading a saved workspace GAP crashed when
    one tried to slice a compressed vector over a
    field with 2 < q <= 256 elements, which had
    already existed in the saved workspace. [Reported
    by Laurent Bartholdi]
 4. FFECONWAY.WriteOverSmallestCommonField tripped up
    when the common field is smaller than the field
    over which some of the vector elements are
    written, because it did a test based on the degree
    of the element, not the field it is written over.
    [Reported by TB]
 5. Fixed the following error: When an FFE in the
    Conway polynomial representation actually lied in
    a field that is handled in the internal
    representation (eg GF(3)) and you tried to write
    it over a bigger field that is ALSO handled
    internally (eg GF(9)) you got an element written
    over the larger field, but in the Conway
    polynomial representation, which is forbidden.
    [Reported by Jack Schmidt]
 6. Attempting to compress a vector containing
    elements of a small finite field represented as
    elements of a bigger (external) field caused a
    segfault. [Reported by Edmund Robertson]
 7. GAP crashed when BlistList was called with a range
    and a list containing large integers or
    non-integers. [Reported by Laurent Bartholdi]
 8. GAP no longer crashes when OnTuples is called with
    a list that contains holes. [Reported by TB]

  Other fixed bugs

 1. `Socle' for the trivial group could produce an
    error message.
 2. DirectoryContents ran into an error for
    immutable strings without trailing slash as
    argument. [Reported by TB]
 3. The functions IsInjective and
    IsSingleValued did not work for general linear
    mappings with trivial (pre)image. [Reported by
    Alper Odabas]
 4. Creating an enumerator for a prime field with more
    than 65536 elements ran into an infinite
    recursion. [Reported by Akos Seress]
 5. The performance of List, Filtered, Number, ForAll,
    and ForAny if applied to non-internally
    represented lists was improved. Also the
    performance of iterators for lists was slightly
    improved.
 6. Finite field elements now know that they can be
    sorted easily which improves performance in
    certain lookups.
 7. A method for IsSubset was missing for the case
    that exactly one argument is an inhomogeneous
    list. [Reported by Laurent Bartholdi]
 8. Long integers in expressions are now printed (was
    not yet implemented). [Reported by TB]
 9. Fixed kernel function for printing records.
10. New C library interfaces (e.g., to ncurses in
    Browse) need some more memory to be allocated with
    'malloc'. The default value of GAPs '-a' option is
    now '2m'.
11. Avoid warnings about pointer types by newer gcc
    compilers.
12. IsBound(l[pos]) was failing for large integer
    <pos> only when coded (eg in a loop or function
    body).
13. ZmodpZObj is now a synonym for ZmodnZObj such that
    from now on such objects print in a way that can
    be read back into GAP.
14. The outdated note that binary streams are not yet
    implemented has been removed.
