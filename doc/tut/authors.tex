The following list gives the authors, indicated by `A', who designed the code in the first
place as well as the current maintainers, indicated by `M' of the various modules of which
{\GAP} is composed.

Since the process of modularization was started only recently, there might
be omissions both in scope and in contributors.  The compilers of the
manual apologize for any such errors and promise to rectify them in future
editions.
