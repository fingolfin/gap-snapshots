If you obtain {\GAP} please send us  a short notice to that effect, e.g.,
an  e-mail  message   to  the  address  \Mailto{support@gap-system.org},
containing your full  name and address.  This  allows us to keep track of
the number of {\GAP} users.

If you  publish  a mathematical  result  that  was  partly obtained using

used (see below for sample citation). Also   we would appreciate if you
could inform us  about such a paper.

The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is  with

In no  case  unless  required by applicable law will we, and/or any other

You  are permitted  to modify and  redistribute  {\GAP},  but you are not
allowed  to restrict further redistribution.  That is to say  proprietary
modifications will  not  be allowed.  We want all  versions  of {\GAP} to
remain free.

If you  modify any part of {\GAP} and redistribute it,  you must supply a
`README'  document.   This should specify what modifications you made  in
which  files.  We do  not  want  to take  credit  or  be blamed  for your
modifications.

Of course we are interested in all of your modifications.  In  particular
we would like to see bug-fixes, improvements and new functions.  So again
we would appreciate it if you would inform us about all modifications you
make.
