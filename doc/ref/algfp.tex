\Chapter{Finitely Presented Algebras}

Currently the {\GAP} library contains only few functions dealing with
general finitely presented algebras,
so this file is merely a placeholder.

The special case of finitely presented *Lie* algebras is described
in~"Finitely Presented Lie Algebras",
and there is also a {\GAP} package `fplsa' for computing structure constants
of *f*initely *p*resented *L*ie (*s*uper)*a*lgebras.

% Finitely presented *associative* algebras will eventually be handled by
% vector enumeration techniques.
