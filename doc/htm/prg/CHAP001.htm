<h1>1 About Programming in GAP</h1><p>
<p>
This is one of four parts of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> documentation,
the others being
the <strong><font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Tutorial</strong>, a beginner's introduction to <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>,
the <strong><font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Reference Manual</strong>,
which contains the official definitions of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>,
and <strong>Extending <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font></strong>,
which explains how to create files and functions that will work
together with mechanisms built in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, how to write documentation,
and so on.
<p>
This manual is divided into chapters.
Each chapter is divided into sections,
and within each section, important definitions are numbered.
References therefore are triples.
<p>
The chapters&nbsp;<a href="CHAP002.htm">Method Selection</a> and <a href="CHAP003.htm">Creating New Objects</a> of this manual
describe how the knowledge about <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> objects is used by the system,
via the so-called method selection mechanism,
and how such knowledge resp.&nbsp;objects with such knowledge can be created.
<p>
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm">Examples of Extending the System</a> gives some simple examples of how
to add new functionality to the system.
<p>
A more involved example for the design of new <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> objects can be found in
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm">An Example -- Residue Class Rings</a>.
In particular,
see Sections&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SECT001">A First Attempt to Implement Elements of Residue Class Rings</a>
and <a href="CHAP005.htm#SECT002">Why Proceed in a Different Way?</a>
for finding out whether this manual is useful for you at all.
One more example is discussed in
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="CHAP006.htm">An Example -- Designing Arithmetic Operations</a>.
<p>
Pages are numbered consecutively in each of the four manuals.
For manual conventions, see Section&nbsp;<a href="../ref/CHAP001.htm#SECT001">Manual Conventions</a>
in the Reference Manual.
