<h1>1 About: Extending GAP</h1><p>
<p>
This is one of four parts of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> documentation,
the others being
the <strong><font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Tutorial</strong>, a beginner's introduction to <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>,
the <strong><font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Reference Manual</strong>,
which contains the official definitions of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>,
and <strong>Programming in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font></strong>
which also provides information for those who want to write their own
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> extensions.
<p>
<strong>Extending <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font></strong> explains how to create files and functions that will work
together with mechanisms built in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.
<p>
This manual is divided into chapters.
Each chapter is divided into sections,
and within each section, important definitions are numbered.
References therefore are triples.
<p>
The first chapters of this manual describe how to write documentation,
how to interface packages and components,
and roughly describes the style used for writing the library.
This is followed by chapters that explain advanced programming techniques in
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.
Finally there are chapters (alas, at the moment there is only one due to a
lack of manpower) that describe how internal functions work and how to
interface ones own code to these internal functions.
<p>
Pages are numbered consecutively in each of the four manuals.
For manual conventions, see Section&nbsp;<a href="../ref/CHAP001.htm#SECT001">Manual Conventions</a>
in the Reference Manual.
