GAP 4.4 Update 12 (December 2008)


  Fixed bugs which could lead to crashes

   A bug whereby leaving an incomplete statement on a 
   line (for instance typing while and then return)
   when prompt colouring was in use could lead to GAP
   crashing.

  Other fixed bugs

   A bug which made the command-line editor unusable
   in a 64 bit version of GAP on Mac OS X.
