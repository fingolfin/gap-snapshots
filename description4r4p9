GAP 4.4 Update 9 (November 2006)                  
                      
  Fixed bugs which could produce wrong results    
                      
 1. The methods of ReadByte for reading from      
    files or terminals returned wrong results for 
    characters in the range [128..255]. [Reported 
    by Yevgen Muntyan]
     
  Other fixed bugs    

 1. A method for the operation PseudoRandom did   
    not succeed.      
 2. A fix for `Orbits' with a set of points as a  
    seed.             
 3. Added a generic method such that Positions    
    works with all types of lists.                
 4. Fixed a problem in choosing the prime in the  
    Dixon-Schneider algorithm. [Reported by       
    Toshio Sumi]      

  New or improved functionality                   

 1. ReducedOrdinary was used in the manual,       
    section 69.17 but was not documented as such, 
    being a synonym for the documented            
    ReducedCharacters. Changed manual examples to 
    use the latter form. [Reported by Vahid
