  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YWhat does the PackageManager package do?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  provides  the  ability to install or remove a package using a
  single  command:  [2XInstallPackage[102X  ([14X2.1-1[114X) or [2XRemovePackage[102X ([14X2.2-1[114X). The user
  can  specify  a  package  to  install  using  its name, or using a URL to an
  archive,   a   repository,   or   a  [10XPackageInfo.g[110X  file.  When  installing,
  PackageManager  also attempts to compile the package, and install the latest
  version of any required packages that are not already available.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YWhat does the PackageManager package not do?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAt  present,  PackageManager  is  fairly basic, without many of the advanced
  features available in package managers such as pip or apt. For instance, the
  user  cannot  install  a  particular version of a package, nor automatically
  update  all  packages.  Removing  a  package  will  not  remove  any  of its
  dependencies,  since  we  do  not  track how packages were installed. When a
  package  is installed, no tests are run to ensure that it is compatible with
  the  installed  version  of GAP. Any of these features might be added in the
  future.  Other  feature  requests  can  be  posted  on  the issue tracker at
  https://github.com/gap-packages/PackageManager/issues.[133X
