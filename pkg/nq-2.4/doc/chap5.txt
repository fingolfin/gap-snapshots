  [33X[0;0YInstallation of the package requires the GNU multiple precision library (GNU
  MP  [GMP]).  If  this  library is not available on your system, it has to be
  installed  first.  A copy of GNU MP can be obtained from [7Xhttp://gmplib.org/[107X.
  Installation  of the ANU NQ is done in two steps. First the configure script
  is run:[133X

    [4X ./configure  [104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YAmong other things it will tell you whether it succeeded in locating the GNU
  MP  library  and  the  corresponding  include files. If it tells you that it
  could not find the GNU MP include files or the GNU MP libraries, you have to
  run configure with additional parameters. For example, if you have installed
  GNU  MP  yourself  in your home directory, you would type something like the
  following[133X

  [33X[0;0YIf configure reports no problems, the next step is to start the compilation:[133X

  [33X[0;0YA  compiled  version  of  the  program  named  `nq'  is then placed into the
  directory `bin/<complicated name>'. The <complicated name> component encodes
  the operating system and the compiler used. This allows you to compile NQ on
  several architectures sharing the same files system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  there  are  any  warnings  or  even  fatal  error  messages  during  the
  compilation  process,  please  send a copy to the address at the end of this
  document together with information about your operating system, the compiler
  you  used  and  any  changes you might have made to the source code. We will
  have a look at your problems and try to fix them.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter  the  compilation  is  finished you can check if the ANU NQ is running
  properly on your system. Simply type[133X
