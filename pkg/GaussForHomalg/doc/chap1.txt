  [1X1.1 Overview over this manual[0X
  
  Chapter  [14X1[0m is concerned with the technical details of installing and running
  this  package. Chapter [14X2[0m explains how [5XGaussForHomalg[0m works and what you need
  to  know  to extend [5Xhomalg[0m with your own rings. Also included in this manual
  is  a  documented  list of the most important methods and functions for this
  linking  process. Anyone interested in source code should just check out the
  files in the [11Xgap/pkg/GaussForHomalg/gap/[0m folder (--> Appendix [14XA[0m).
  
  
  [1X1.2 Installation of the [5XGaussForHomalg[1X Package[0X
  
  To  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [11Xpkg/[0m  directory.  By default the [5XGaussForHomalg[0m package is not automatically
  loaded  by  [5XGAP[0m  when  it  is  installed.  You  must  load  the package with
  [10XLoadPackage("GaussForHomalg");[0m   before   its  functions  become  available.
  Please,  send  me an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions,
  etc.   concerning   [5XGaussForHomalg[0m.   Also,  I  would  like  to  hear  about
  applications of this package.
