  [33X[0;0YThere  are  two categories below: [10XFRMachine[110X and [10XFRElement[110X. An [10XFRMachine[110X must
  have  a [10XStateSet[110X, and methods for [10XOutput[110X and a [10XTransition[110X. An [10XFRElement[110X must
  have  an  underlying [10XFRMachine[110X and [10XInitialState[110X, and [10XOutput[110X and a [10XTransition[110X

  [1X11.3-2 [33X[0;0YOrder of FR elements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  order  of an FR element [10Xe[110X is computed as follows: the tree is traversed
  recursively,  filling it as follows. For each cycle of [10Xe[110X on the first level,
  the  product  of the states on that cycle are computed. The method continues
  recursively  with  that  product, remembering the order of the cycle. Once a
  state reappears in the traversal, [5XFR[105X determines if one instance of the state
  is  in the subtree of the other, and if so whether the top one was raised to
  a  non-trivial  power  to  yield the second one as a state. If this happens,
  then  [10Xe[110X  has  infinite  order.  Otherwise,  the least common multiple of the
  powers that appeared in the traversal is returned.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  method  is guaranteed to succeed if [10Xe[110X is a bounded element. To improve
  chances   of   success,   [5XFR[105X   first  computes  whether  [10Xe[110X  acts  by  vertex
  transformations  belonging to an abelian group; and if so, if [10Xe[110X is conjugate
  to an adding machine. In that case too, [10Xe[110X has infinite order.[133X
  
  
  [1X11.3-3 [33X[0;0YMembership in semigroups[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe following algorithm is used to determine whether a Mealy element belongs
  to  a  self-similar  group. The corresponding problem of membership of an FR
  element in a state-closed self-similar group can be much simpler, because an
  FR  element  has an associated FR machine, all of whose states belong to the
  group.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAssume  the  group  is given by generators. [5XFR[105X attempts to express the given
  Mealy  element  as  a product of generators. At the same time, it constructs
  epimorphisms  to  finite groups. It is hoped that one of these two processes
  will stop.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  amounts,  in  fact,  to  the following. Consider a group [22XG[122X acting on a
  tree.  It  has  a  natural, profinite closure [22Xoverline G[122X. The algorithm then
  attempts either to write an element [22Xx[122X as a product of generators of [3XG[103X, or to
  show that [22Xx[122X does not belong to [22Xoverline G[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  groups  [22XG[122X  such  that [22Xoverline G∖ G[122X contains Mealy machines. For
  these, the above algorithm will not terminate.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn   additional   refinement   is   implemented   for  bounded  groups  (see
  [2XIsBoundedFRSemigroup[102X  ([14X7.2-14[114X)).  The  [2XGerms[102X  ([14X5.2-24[114X)  of  an  element  are
  computed, and compared to the germs of elements in the group.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally,  for a group that possesses self-similar data (see Section [14X11.3-5[114X),
  very  fast methods are implemented to recognize and express an FR element as
  a product of generators.[133X
  
  
  [1X11.3-4 [33X[0;0YOrder of groups[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  order  of  an  FR  group  is computed as follows: if all generators are
  finitary,  then  enumeration  will  succeed  in  computing the order. If the
  action  of  the  group  is  primitive,  and  it  comes  from  a bireversible
  automaton,  then  the  Thompson-Wielandt  theorem  is  tested  against. This
  theorem states that, in our context (a group acting on a rooted tree, coming
  from  a  larger  group acting transitively), if the group is finite then the
  stabilizer  of  a  sphere  of radius 2 is a [22Xp[122X-group; see [BM00a, Proposition
  2.1.1].  Then, [5XFR[105X attempts to find whether the group is level-transitive (in
  which  case  it  would  be  infinite). Finally, it attempts to enumerate the
  group's  elements,  testing  at  the  same  time whether these elements have
  infinite order.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNeedless to say, none except the first few steps are guaranteed to succeed.[133X
  
  
  [1X11.3-5 [33X[0;0YImages and preimages of some groups in f.p. and l.p. groups[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YContracting,  branched  groups  admit finite L-presentations (see [Bar03b]),
  that   is,   presentations   by   finitely  many  generators,  relators  and
  endomorphisms;  the  (usual)  relators  are the images of the given relators
  under iteration by all endomorphisms.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUsing  the  package  [5XNQL[105X,  it  is  possible  to construct infinite nilpotent
  quotients of self-similar groups, and perform fast computations in them.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is possible to construct, algorithmically, such an L-presentation from a
  self-similar  groups;  however, this algorithm has not been implemented yet,
  mainly  because  efficiency  issues  would  make  it usable only in very few
  cases.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  groups  with  an  isomorphism  to  an L-presented group (constructed by
  [2XIsomorphismLpGroup[102X  ([14X7.2-31[114X)),  a  fast  method  expresses group elements as
  words  in the L-presented group's generators. It proceeds recursively on the
  decomposition of the element, mapping elements that are expressible by short
  words  over  the  nucleus  (usually  length  1;  length  3 is needed for the
  [2XBrunnerSidkiVieiraGroup[102X  ([14X10.1-14[114X)) to their value in the L-presented group,
  and   using   the   presentation's  endomorphism  to  construct  words  with
  appropriate decompositions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  particular,  the  algorithm  will  stop,  returning  [9Xfail[109X, if during the
  recursion it reaches an element [22Xx[122X such that [22Xx[122X is a state of [22Xx[122X but [22Xx[122X does not
  belong to the nucleus.[133X
  
  
  [1X11.3-6 [33X[0;0YComparison of FR, Mealy, vector, and algebra elements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YFR and Mealy elements can be compared quite efficiently, as long as they are
  distinct.  The  algorithm  runs as follows: let the two elements be [22Xx[122X and [22Xy[122X.
  Considering  both  in turn, [5XFR[105X constructs the first entries of minimal Mealy
  elements  expressing  [22Xx[122X  and [22Xy[122X; as soon as an output entry is distinct for [22Xx[122X
  and  for  [22Xy[122X,  the  status of [22Xx<y[122X is determined; and similarly for transition
  entries.  Finally,  if either of [22Xx[122X or [22Xy[122X is finite-state and the entries were
  identical  up  to  that  step,  then  the  element with smallest stateset is
  considered smaller.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  this  way,  FR and Mealy elements can efficiently be compared. For Mealy
  elements,  it suffices to follow their internal data; while for FR elements,
  this  amounts  to  constructing  Mealy  elements  approximating  them  to  a
  sufficient precision so that they can be compared as such.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  algorithm  first tries to test its arguments for equality; this test is
  not guaranteed to succeed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA similar algorithm applies for linear elements. Here, one constructs vector
  element approximations; and compares, for ever-increasing values of [22Xi[122X, first
  the  output  vectors  of basis state [22Xi[122X; then the transitions from state [22Xi[122X to
  state  [22Xj[122X,  for all [22Xj∈{1,...,i}[122X; then the transitions from state [22Xj[122X to state [22Xi[122X
  for all [22Xj∈{1,...,i-1}[122X.[133X
  
  
  [1X11.3-7 [33X[0;0YInverses of linear elements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  probably  difficult  to compute the inverse of a vector element. The
  following  approach  is  used:  to  compute the inverse of [22Xx[122X, large (scalar)
  matrix  approximations  of  [22Xx[122X  are  computed; they are inverted using linear
  algebra;  a  vector  element  representing  this inverse is guessed; and the
  guess  is  checked.  As  long as that check fails, larger approximations are
  computed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNeedless to say, this method need not succeed; for there are vector elements
  that  are invertible, but whose inverse is not a vector element. A good test
  example  appears  in  [Bac08]:  consider the infinite matrix with 1's on the
  diagonal,  and  [22Xω[122X  below the diagonal. This element admits an inverse if and
  only  if  [22Xω[122X  is  a root of unity. The complexity of the inverse grows as the
  degree of [22Xω[122X grows. Here is an illustation:[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[5XFR[105X contains algorithms that convert a rational function (with floating-point
  complex coefficients) to an IMG machine and back.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YConsider  a rational map [22Xf[122X of degree [22Xd[122X. First, compute the post-critical set
  [22XP_f[122X;  this is done by iterating [22Xf[122X on critical points, and considering points
  at angle at most [22XEPS@.prec[122X from each other as equal.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThen construct a spherical Delaunay triangulation [22XT[122X on [22XP_f[122X; and choose in it
  a  minimal  spanning  tree; edges of that tree represent a generating set of
  the fundamental group [22XG[122X of [22XS^2∖ P_f[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLift  first  through [22Xf[122X the edges of the dual tree in the dual tesselation of
  [22XT[122X;  they  will  form  [22Xd[122X connected subgraphs, numbered [22X1,...,d[122X. Lift then the
  edges  crossing  the  minimal spanning tree, and read the elements of [22XF[122X that
  their  lifts represent, as well as the subgraphs they start and end in. This
  data describes an FR machine.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YChoose  then  for  each  vertex  in  [22XP_f[122X an adjacent face in [22XT/[122X. This choice
  defines  a generating family of [22XF[122X made up, for each vertex, of a path in the
  dual  tree  starting  at  a  basepoint,  a sequence of edges around a vertex
  starting  at the chosen face, and a path back in the dual tree. The product,
  in an appropriate order, of these generators describes an IMG machine.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  is  an  epimorphism from the group [22XG[122X, generated by these loops around
  vertices,  to  [22XF[122X; and this epimorphism becomes an isomorphism if one adds to
  [22XG/[122X  the  relation  "product  of  generators in an appropriate order". Such a
  triangulation,  with  a  given  group  [22XG[122X  and a homomorphism from [22XG[122X to [22XF[122X, is
  called a [13Xspider[113X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  inverse  algorithm  is  quite  similar. Consider an IMG machine [22XM[122X, with
  stateset  [22XG[122X.  Start  by  a  "standard"  set of points on the sphere, one per
  generator of [22XM[122X, and construct a spider [22XS[122X on them. Find a rational map [22Xf[122X with
  critical  values  at the vertices of [22XS[122X and monodromy given by the activities
  of  [22XM[122X,  and  lift  [22XS[122X to a spider [22XT[122X, marked by a group [22XH[122X. The lifting gives a
  homomorphism [22Xf^*:G-> H≀ Sym(d)[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy   appropriately  relabeling  the  alphabet,  one  can  ensure  that  this
  homomorphism  coincides  with [22XM[122X's recursion at the first level. Furthermore,
  it  identifies  each  vertex  [22Xv_i[122X of [22XT[122X either with a vertex [22Xw_j[122X of [22XS[122X, if for
  some  [22Xg∈  G[122X  a  state  in [22XM[122X of [22Xg[122X is a conjugate [22Xg_j[122X, while the corresponding
  entry of [22Xf^*(g)[122X is a conjugate of [22Xh_i[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YConstruct  then  a  new triangulation [22XS'[122X by keeping only those vertices of [22XT[122X
  that  were  identified,  and  mapping  them  by a Möbius transformation [22Xμ[122X to
  "standard position". This means that the barycenter of the points is [22X0∈ R^3[122X,
  that  the  last  point  goes  to  [22X∞[122X,  and that the next-to-last goes to [22XR_+[122X.
  Letting  [22XF[122X  denote  the group on the minimal spanning tree of [22XS'[122X, there is a
  homomorphism [22Xμ_*:H-> F[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  decomposition  [22Xϕ[122X  of  [22XM[122X  then produces a homomorphism [22Xm:G-> F[122X such that
  [22Xμ_*f^*=mϕ[122X.  This turns [22XS'[122X into a spider on [22XG[122X. Iterate then this process with
  [22XS'[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEither  the  spiders  [22XS[122X  converge,  and  then  [22Xμ^-1f[122X is the desired rational
  function;  or  there  is  a Thurston obstruction, which is a non-contracting
  multicurve.  Seek  therefore  clusters  of vertices that are very close from
  each  other,  and  compute  the  curve  going  around  them;  this defines a
  conjugacy  class  in  [22XG[122X.  In  [22XM[122X,  compute the iterated decomposition of this
  curve,  and its associated transition matrix. If it has spectrum at least [22X1[122X,
  return the multicurve as an obstruction; otherwise, continue.[133X
