FR requires external libraries for its DLL. The compilation script will
download them automatically for you; they can also be fetched manually,
using the commands

wget http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gsl/gsl-1.15.tar.gz
wget --no-check-certificate https://forge.imag.fr/frs/download.php/202/givaro-3.6.0.tar.gz
