  [33X[0;0YWith Polycyclic 3.0, the package interface was changed. This was done to get
  the  names  of  Polycyclic  functions  to  agree  with  the  general  naming
  conventions used throughout GAP. Also, some polycyclic operations duplicated
  functionality  that  was  already  available  in  the  core  of  GAP under a
  different  name;  in  these  cases,  whenever  possible  we  now install the
  polycyclic code as methods for the existing GAP operations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  backward  compatibility,  we  still  provide the old, obsolete names as
  aliases.  However,  please  consider  switching  to the new names as soon as
  possible.  The  old  names  may  be  completely removed at some point in the
  future.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe following function names were changed.[133X
