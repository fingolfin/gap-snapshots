    &Francy; arose from the necessity of having a lightweight framework forbuilding interactive graphics, generated from GAP, running primarily on theweb, primarily in a Jupyter Notebook. An initial attempt to re-use XGAP andport it was made, but the lack
    of a standardized data exchange format betweenGAP and the graphics renderer, and the simplistic initial requirements of the project were the basis for the creation of a new GAP package.

    <Heading>Applications</Heading>

    &Francy; has potentially many applications and can be &Francy; 3 used to provide a graphical representation of data structures, allowing one to navigate through and explore properties or relations of these structures. In this way, &Francy; can be used
    to enrich a learning environment where GAP provides a library of thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. Example packages using &Francy;: &FrancyMonoids;, &SubgroupLattice;

    <Heading>Functionality</Heading>
    &Francy; provides an interface to draw graphics using objects. This interface is based on simple concepts of drawing and graph theory, allowing the creation of directed and undirected graphs, trees, line charts, bar charts and scatter charts. These graphical
    objects are drawn inside a canvas that includes a space for menus and to display informative messages. Within the canvas it is possible to interact with the graphical objects by clicking, selecting, dragging and zooming

    <Heading>Installation</Heading>

    This package requires the &GAP; packages &JupyterKernel; and &json;, all of which are distributed with &GAP;. &Francy; follows a similar installation procedure to &JupyterKernel;, so it requires &Jupyter; to be installed on your system. Please note, you
    need to run the installation command from the same python version &Jupyter; is installed on. In order to install &Francy;, please run the following command to download the latest version available from
    <URL>https://pypi.org/</URL>:
    <Log>
      pip install jupyter_francy -U
    </Log>

    It is necessary to enable &Francy; on your &Jupyter; installation:
    <Log>
      jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyter_francy
    </Log>

    <Heading>How it works</Heading>

    &Francy; requires a rendering package to display graphics. &Francy; uses Renderers based on d3.js and Graphviz, for rendering the semantic representation produced by the GAP package. This library is distributed both as a browser module and as a Jupyter
    extension. The Jupyter extension can be used in Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab, using the &JupyterKernel; and the MIME type application/vnd.francy+json to render the document Please check the documentation for more information:
