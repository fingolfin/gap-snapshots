                   ----------------------------------------
                   | CHANGES of the numericalsgps package |
                   ----------------------------------------

0.97 -> 0.971
- Fixed some bugs related to the numerical semigroup N. (These bugs did not produce wrong results.) 
- New functions added
	-SaturatedNumericalSemigroupClosure
	-IsSaturatedNumericalSemigroup
	-AsGluingOfNumericalSemigroups
	-IsACompleteIntersectionNumericalSemigroup

0.96 -> 0.97
- Removed (for the sake of non-dependencies and simplicity: in particular, the folder "src" so as the files "drawapery.g*" and "xnumsgp.g*" containing the functions below have been removed) 
	-DrawAperyListOfNumericalSemigroup
	-XDrawAperyListOfNumericalSemigroup
	-XNumericalSemigroup

- Fixed bugs in 
	-IsSubsemigroupOfNumericalSemigroup
	-TameDegreeOfElementInNumericalSemigroup
	-NumericalSemigroupByFundamentalGaps
	-Random[[Proportionally]Modular]NumericalSemigroup

- Improvements in 
	- MinimalGeneratingSystemOfNumericalSemigroup (the case of a semigroup given by generators is new)
	- NumericalSemigroup (when the generators form a range (i.e., an interval of integers); when the semigroup is given by a closed interval with rational ends or when the semigroup is given as a proportionally modular semigroup;  when the semigroup is given by two generators it is immediately seen as modular semigroup; modular semigroups are also proportionally modular semigroups and proportionally modular semigroups of proportion 1 are modular semigroups -- this information is stored so that specific algorithms can be immediately used)

- New functions added
	-GenusOfNumericalSemigroup
	-ConductorOfNumericalSemigroup
	-TypeOfNumericalSemigroup
	-EmbeddingDimensionOfNumericalSemigroup
	-BettiElementsOfNumericalSemigroup 
	-IsGradedAssociatedRingNumericalSemigroupBuchsbaum (by A. Sammartano)
	-IsMpureNumericalSemigroup (by A. Sammartano)
	-IsPureNumericalSemigroup (by A. Sammartano)
	-IsGradedAssociatedRingNumericalSemigroupGorenstein (by A. Sammartano)
	-ReducedSetOfGeneratorsOfNumericalSemigroup

- New methods for existing functions
	-MultiplicityOfNumericalSemigroup (for semigroups given by intervals of rationals)

- Improved methods for existing functions
	- FrobeniusNumberOfNumericalSemigroup (a new algorithm for modular NS)
	- FrobeniusNumberOfNumericalSemigroup (the general method now uses Johnson's reduction, when possible; a fast algorithm for semigroups of embedding dimension 3 has been implemented)
	- SmallElementsOfNumericalSemigroup (As a numerical semigroup generated by an interval is automatically proportionally modular, the method for PM semigroups is used)

- Added documentation for the new functions and for 
	-TameDegreeOfElementInNumericalSemigroup

0.95 -> 0.96

- New functions added:
      - CatenaryDegreeOfElementNS
      - CatenaryDegreeOfElementNS_NC
      - NumericalSemigroupsWithGenus
      - IsMonomialSemigroupRing

- fixed bugs in 
      - IsProportionallyModularNumericalSemigroup
      - SmallElementsOfNumericalSemigroup
      - FactorizationsElementWRTNumericalSemigroup
      - BelongsToNumericalSemigroup [0\in S]
      

- improvements in 
      - MinimalGeneratingSystemOfNumericalSemigroup
      - DrawAperyListOfNumericalSemigroup [to be usable in Windows]
      - GraphAssociatedToElementInNumericalSemigroup
