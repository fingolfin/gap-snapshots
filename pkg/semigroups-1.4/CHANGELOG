1.3 -> 1.4  
            This is a minor release containing some bug fixes. Specifically:
            the functionality of ReadGenerators and WriteGenerators has been
            improved to allow the argument to be an IO file object, and support
            is added to read and write directly to files compressed using
            xz. A minor bug relating to the creation of idempotents in
            transformation semigroups which was triggered by the identity
            transformation has been resolved. The functions
            IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup, InjectionPrincipalFactor, and
            IsZeroSimpleSemigroup have been revised. IsZeroSimpleSemigroup
            formerly returned true for the 2 element zero semigroup, which is
            not 0-simple. IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup could have returned an
            error if called for a semigroup which was not a semigroup of
            partial perms or transformations. The use of AsPermutation was
            changed to PermutationOfImage where appropriate following a change
            to the library methods for AsPermutation. The declarations of
            IsomorphismPermGroup and ClosureSemigroup were moved/changed to
            avoid warnings that their methods matched more than one
            declaration. These warnings were exposed by doing LoadAllPackages,
            but were not present when loading Semigroups by itself.

1.2 -> 1.3  
            Version 1.3 contains many bug fixes, extensions and improvements in
            the documentation, and several new methods and functions. Most
            notably are (in no particular order): 
            
            • the methods in Semigroups have been extended to apply to
            arbitrary subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over
            groups; 
            
            • a new method for MaximalSubsemigroups of Rees matrix
            semigroup has been implemented; 
            
            • the function Read/WriteSemigroups have been renamed
            Read/WriteGenerators and their performance has been improved. It is
            now possible to use WriteGenerators to write to a gzipped file; 

            • the operation SingularSemigroup has been renamed
            SingularTransformationSemigroup;

            • the following attributes have been introduced: MinimalDClass,
            MaximalDClasses, StructureDescriptionMaximalSubgroups,
            StructureDescriptionSchutzenbergerGroups, and IsGreensDLeq.
            
            • the attribute/operation DotDClasses has been introduced. This
            allows the D-class diagram of a semigroup to be viewed.

            • ComponentRepsOfTransformationSemigroup is reintroduced.

1.1 -> 1.2
            This release includes several new methods for inverse semigroups of
            partial permutations and for free inverse semigroups. Most notably
            among the new methods for inverse semigroups of partial
            permutations are:

                SmallerDegreePartialPermRepresentation 
            
            and 
                
                VagnerPrestonRepresentation

            for changing the representation of an inverse semigroup of partial 
            permutations. The changes in this release were the result of the 
            University of St Andrews Research for Undergraduates Summer School 
            in 2012, and were largely written by Wilf Wilson and Robert Hancock.

            Free inverse semigroups, and their elements, are also introduced,
            this part of the package was written by Julius Jonusas (who wishes
            to acknowledge the support of the Carnegie Trust).

1.0 -> 1.1  
            A minor release to fix some technical issues in PackageInfo.g, the
            declarations of IsGreens.Class, and a minor change in the output in
            one test in everyfunction.tst which was consequence of the
            declarations of IsGreens.Class.

0.9999 -> 1.0
            The package has been renamed from Citrus to Semigroups. The package
            has been completely overhauled, the performance has been improved,
            and the code has been generalized so that in the future the same
            code can be used to compute with other types of semigroups.  

Under the name Citrus:

0.999 -> 0.9999
            This is the final release of Citrus (the package will be renamed
            Citrus in the next release since the scope of the package has
            expanded to include more types of semigroups than just those of
            transformations and partial permutations).

            A minor release fixing several bugs relating to inverse semigroups
            of partial permutations pointed out by partcipants at the
            University of St Andrews Research for Undergraduates Summer School
            in July 2012.  Most notably by Demi Allen, Casey Donoven, Rhiannon
            Dougall, Robert Hancock, and Wilf Wilson. More specifically,
            SymmetricInverseSemigroup(n) returned an incorrect answer when n=1
            or n=2, \in for the empty mapping and an inverse semigroup of
            partial perms sometimes incorrectly returned false, some harmless
            compiler warnings were displayed when using more recent versions of
            gcc, NaturalLeqPP sometimes returned the incorrect value, there was
            no method for IsInverseSemigroup or IsInverseMonoid for a semigroup
            of partial perms.

0.99 -> 0.999 
            A minor release fixing several bugs relating to partial
            permutations and monoids thereof, pointed out by Jack Schmidt.
            More specifically, MultiplicativeZero sometimes incorrectly
            returned fail for a inverse semigroup of partial permutations,
            sometimes PartialPerm incorrectly returned fail when given a dense
            range as an argument, sometimes the size of an inverse monoid was 1
            more than the correct value, and RestrictedPP sometimes failed when
            it should not have. 

0.9 -> 0.99 
            another minor release. Specific changes were: removed the
            declaration of SmallGeneratingSet for IsSemigroup since it appears
            not to be used and caused a warning to be shown when rcwa was
            loaded after Citrus. Added a new abstract to the PackageInfo.g
            file, and the documentation, and updated the webpages, in
            particular so that the html version of the manual is linked to that
            on the GAP webpage and the links to other manuals work. 

0.8 -> 0.9 
            renamed the function for creating the semigroup of order-preserving
            transformations on an n-chain from O to OrderEndomorphisms after it
            was pointed out that it is not sensible to have function names with
            one character. Also made some minor adjustments to the manual.

0.7 -> 0.8 
            minor changes due to incompatibility with Smallsemi 0.6.4 which 
            caused some test files to fail when Nilmat was loaded after
            Citrus.  The clashes and the failed test were caused by various
            properties being declared for IsTransformationSemigroup rather than
            IsSemigroup. 

0.6 -> 0.7 
            the most major change is the introduction of special methods for
            partial permutations and inverse semigroups. So that these methods
            are efficient, a GAP kernel component (in C) has also been
            introduced for various low-level computations with partial
            permutations. Essentially all functions previously available for
            transformation semigroups are now available for inverse semigroups
            of partial permutations. The manual has been expanded and
            reorganised, some standard examples have been included (semigroups
            of order preserving transformations or partial permutations, the
            symmetric inverse semigroup, the full matrix semigroup over a
            finite field), the endomorphism monoids of the non-abelian groups
            with at most 64 elements have been included in the catalogues of
            examples, the functions InjectionPrincipalFactor,
            IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup, and PrincipalFactor, and some
            specific properties and attributes of inverse semigroups have been
            introduced (such as IsFactorisableSemigroup and
            PrimitiveIdempotents).

0.5 -> 0.6 
            fixed a bug relating to the creation of transformation semigroups 
            using MagmaByGenerators. Also added the global variable 
            CitrusOptionsRec containing the default values of the options
            used by Citrus when creating a semigroup. 

0.4 -> 0.5
            major changes are: the documentation has been further revised,
            functions for creating semigroups and monoids with certain
            options have been introduced, several functions have had the word
            `Greens' removed from their names to reduce the length, the
            operation ClosureSemigroup has been introduced, the functions
            ReadCitrus and WriteCitrus for reading and writing
            transformations to a file have been introduced, several catalogues
            of examples of transformation semigroups are now included in the
            examples directory, methods for creating a Green's class inside
            another Green's class have been included (such as an R-class of a
            D-class or an H-class of an L-class), the hash functions used for
            transformations etc have been improved. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:

            AntiIsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a trans. semigroup),
            IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigp, IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup
            (for a perm. gp), IsomorphismTransformationMonoid (for a perm. gp),
            NrElementsOfRank.

0.3 -> 0.4
            major changes are: the documentation has been updated, some changes
            to core functions for R-classes/image orbits have resulted in a 
            performance improvement, there is a method for the operation
            Factorization allowing an arbitrary element of a transformation
            semigroup to be expressed as a product of the generators. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:
            
            OrbSCC, OrbSCCLookup, OrbSCCTruthTable, 
            ReverseSchreierTreeOfSCC, SchreierTreeOfSCC,
            IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a perm. gp). 

0.2 -> 0.3 
            fixed a critical (but rare) bug in AddToOrbitsOfKernels that caused
            computations relating to D-classes, H-classes, or L-classes to
            return incorrect answers in some cases. 

0.1 -> 0.2  
            updated the method for \^ for a transformation and perm so that it
            is more efficient than the library method, same for \* for a perm 
            and transformation. New method for StructureDescription of a
            Brandt semigroup, and IsSubset for a trans. semigroup and trans.
            coll. 
    
            fixed bugs in IndexPeriodOfTransformation (it returned incorrect
            results) and AsPermutation. Also reduce hash table lengths so that 
            Citrus uses less memory. Fixed bug that triggered an infinite
            loop when trying to find elements of a trivial trans. semigroup.  

            added the functions CitrusDefaultMem, CitrusHiMem,
            CitrusLoMem, CitrusVeryLoMem, IsBrandtSemigroup,
            IsLeftSimple, IsMonogenicSemigroup, IsRightSimple,
            IsZeroRectangularBand, IsZeroSimpleSemigroup.
