  <Section><Heading>An important note</Heading>
    The operations, methods, properties, and functions
    described in this manual only apply to semigroups of transformations,
    partial permutations, and subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups
    over groups. For the sake of brevity, we have opted to say
    <B>semigroup</B> rather than <B>semigroup of transformations, partial
      permutations, and subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over
      groups</B>.

  <Section><Heading>Introduction</Heading>
    This is the manual for the &Semigroups; package version &VERSION;.
    &Semigroups; &VERSION; is an updated and expanded version of the 
    <URL Text="Monoid package for GAP 3">
      http://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html</URL> by Goetz Pfeiffer,
    Steve A. Linton, Edmund F. Robertson, and Nik Ruskuc and
    the <URL Text="Monoid package for GAP 4">
      http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/monoid/index.html</URL> by
    J.  D. Mitchell.<P/>

    Some of the theory behind the algorithms in &Semigroups; is described in 
    <Cite Key="pfeiffer1"/> and described in <Cite Key="pfeiffer2"/>.  Another
    reference is <Cite Key="lallement"/>. A reference for free inverse
    semigroups is Section 5.10 in <Cite Key="howie"/>. The functions for:
    finding a smaller degree partial permutation representation of an inverse
    semigroup are based on <Cite Key="Schein1992aa"/>; and finding the
    maximal subsemigroups of a Rees matrix or 0-matrix semigroup are based on
    Remark 1 in <Cite Key="Graham1968aa"/>.
    <P/>
    
    &Semigroups; &VERSION; retains all the functionality of the original
    &Monoid; for &GAP; 3; and those functions from &Monoid; 3.1.4 not involved
    in the computation of automorphism groups of semigroups.<P/>

    &noindent; &Semigroups; &VERSION; contains more efficient methods than those
    available in the &GAP; library (and in many cases more efficient than any
    other software) for creating semigroups, calculating their Green's classes,
    size, elements, group of units, minimal ideal, and testing membership,
    finding the inverses of a regular element, and factorizing elements over
    the generators, and many more; see Chapters <Ref Chap="create"/> and  <Ref
      Chap="green"/>. There are also methods for testing if a semigroup
    satisfies a particular property, such as if it is regular, simple, inverse,
    completely regular, and a variety of further properties; see Chapter <Ref
      Chap="green"/>. 
    Several standard examples of semigroups are provided see Section 
    <Ref Sect="Examples"/>.  &Semigroups; also provides abbreviated names for
    some of the commonly used &GAP; library functions related to semigroups,
    and functions to read and write collections of transformations or
    partial permutations to a file; see <Ref Func="ReadGenerators"/> and <Ref
      Func="WriteGenerators"/>. 
    <P/>

    There are also functions in &Semigroups; to define and manipulate free
    inverse semigroups and their elements; this part of the package was written
    by Julius Jonu&#353;as.<P/>

    &noindent; The &Semigroups; package is written &GAP; code and 
    requires the &Orb; and &IO;packages. The &Orb; package is used
    to efficiently compute components of actions, which underpin many of the
    features of &Semigroups;.  The &IO; package is used to read and write
    transformations and partial permutations to a file.  The &Grape; package is
    used in the functions <Ref Oper="MunnSemigroup"/> and <Ref
      Attr="MaximalSubsemigroups"/> but nowhere else in &Semigroups;. If
    &Grape; is not available, then &Semigroups; can be used as normal
    with the exception that <Ref Oper="MunnSemigroup"/> and <Ref
      Attr="MaximalSubsemigroups"/> will not work.  <P/>
    
    &Semigroups; is still under development, and so some features may not
    function as expected. At the present time, I do not know of any errors or
    serious issues with &Semigroups;.  If you find a bug or an issue with the
    package, then please let me know by emailing me the details at:
    <Email>jdm3@st-and.ac.uk</Email>.<P/>

    For more details about semigroups in &GAP; or Green's relations in
    particular, see <Ref Sect="Semigroups" BookName="ref"/> or

    <Heading>Installing the &Semigroups; package</Heading>

    In this section we give a brief description of how to start using
    &Semigroups;. If you have any problems getting &Semigroups; working, then
    you could try emailing me at <Email>jdm3@st-and.ac.uk</Email>. <P/>

    It is assumed that you have a working copy of &GAP; with version number 
    &GAPVERS; or higher. The most up-to-date version of &GAP; and instructions
    on how to install it can be obtained from the main &GAP; webpage
    &vspace;<P/>&noindent;&vspace;
    <URL>http://www.gap-system.org</URL><P/>

    &noindent; The following is a summary of the steps that should lead to a
    successful installation of &Semigroups;:
    <List>
     <Item> ensure that the &IO; package version &IOVERS; or higher is
       available. For more details go to:&vspace;<P/>&noindent;
      <URL>http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/ io.html
      </URL>
      </Item>
      
      <Item> ensure that the &Orb; package version 
      &ORBVERS; or higher is available. For more details go to:
      &vspace;<P/>&noindent; 
      <URL>http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html
      </URL><P/>
      &noindent; Note that &Orb; and &Semigroups; both perform better if &Orb;
      is compiled. 
      </Item>

      <Item>  if you want to be able to calculate the Munn semigroup of a
        semilattice or the maximal subsemigroups of
        a Rees 0-matrix semigroup, then make sure that 
        the &Grape; package version &GRAPEVERS; or higher is available.  For
        more details go to:&vspace;<P/>&noindent;
        <URL>http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/</URL><P/>
        If &Grape; is not fully installed, then &Semigroups; can be used as
        normal with the exception that <Ref Oper="MunnSemigroup"/>
        will not work. The method for <Ref Attr="MaximalSubsemigroups"/> will
        work provided &Grape; can be loaded, i.e. it is not necessary for
        &Grape; to be compiled.
      </Item>

      <Item> download the package archive <F>&ARCHIVENAME;.tar.gz</F> from
      &vspace;<P/>&noindent;&vspace;
      <URL>http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups.php</URL>
      </Item>
    
      <Item> unzip and untar the file, this should create a directory called
      <F>&ARCHIVENAME;</F>.</Item>
    
      <Item> 
      locate the <F>pkg</F> directory of your &GAP; directory, which contains
      the directories <F>lib</F>, <F>doc</F> and so on. Move the directory
      <F>&ARCHIVENAME;</F> into the <F>pkg</F> directory.  
      </Item>

      <!--     <Item> to use the functions in &Semigroups; for partial permutations and
        inverse semigroups, you must compile the C part of the package 
        (in the "pkg" directory) by doing:
        <Listing>
<![CDATA[cd semigroups
./configure
make]]></Listing>
    Further information about this step can be found in Section <Ref Sect="Compiling"/>. 
    </Item>-->

    <Item> start &GAP; in the usual way.</Item>
  
    <Item> type <C>LoadPackage("semigroups");</C></Item>
    
    <Item> compile the documentation by using <Ref Func="SemigroupsMakeDoc"/>
    </Item>

  </List>
  
  <!--    <E><B>Please note that</B> &Semigroups; can only be used to compute with
      semigroups of partial permutations if it has been compiled.  </E><P/>-->

    Presuming that the above steps can be completed successfully you will be 
    running the &Semigroups; package!<P/>

    If you want to check that the package is working correctly, you
    should run some of the tests described in Section <Ref Sect="testing"/>.<P/>

  </Section>

  <!-- <Section Label="Compiling">
    <Heading>Compiling the kernel component of &Semigroups;</Heading>
As of version 0.7, the &Semigroups; package has a &GAP; kernel component in C which
should be compiled. This component contains low-level functions relating to
partial permutations and it is not possible to use these features or any
related features in &Semigroups; without compiling the package. It is possible to
run &Semigroups; without compiling it, but &Semigroups; is limited to computing with
transformation semigroups in this case.<P/>

To compile the GAP kernel component in the 'pkg' directory do:
<Listing>
<![CDATA[cd semigroups
./configure
make]]></Listing><P/>

If you installed the package in another 'pkg' directory than the standard 'pkg'
directory in your &GAP; installation, then you have to do two things. Firstly
during compilation you have to use the option '--with-gaproot=PATH' of the
'configure' script where 'PATH' is a path to the main GAP root directory (if
not given the default '../..' is assumed).<P/>

If you installed &GAP; on several architectures, you must execute the
configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either do this
immediately after configuring and compiling GAP itself on this architecture, or
alternatively (when using version 4.5 of GAP or newer) set the environment
variable 'CONFIGNAME' to the name of the configuration you used when compiling
GAP before running './configure'.  Note however that your compiler choice and
flags (environment variables 'CC' and 'CFLAGS') need to be chosen to match the
setup of the original GAP compilation. For example you have to specify 32-bit
or 64-bit mode correctly!

<Section Label="doc"><Heading>Compiling the documentation</Heading>

  To compile the documentation use <Ref Func="SemigroupsMakeDoc"/>. If you want
  to use the help system, it is essential that you compile the documentation.

  </Section>
    
  <Section Label="testing"><Heading>Testing the installation</Heading>
    
    In this section we describe how to test that &Semigroups; is working as
    intended.  To test that &Semigroups; is installed correctly use 
    <Ref Func="SemigroupsTestInstall"/> or for more extensive tests use 
    <Ref Func="SemigroupsTestAll"/>. Please note that it will take a few
    seconds for <Ref Func="SemigroupsTestInstall"/> to finish and it may take
    several minutes for <Ref Func="SemigroupsTestAll"/> to finish.<P/>

    Note that after calling <Ref Func="SemigroupsTestAll"/>, <Ref
      Func="SemigroupsTestAll"/>, or <Ref
      Func="SemigroupsTestManualExamples"/>, the message <C>gzip: stdout:
      Broken pipe</C> might be displayed (several times). While this is
    unfortunate, it is not an error and should simply be ignored.  We hope to
    resolve this issue in the future.

    If something goes wrong, then please review the instructions in Section
    <Ref Sect="install"/> and ensure that &Semigroups; has been properly
    installed.  If you continue having problems, please email me at
    <Email>jdm3@st-and.ac.uk</Email>.

    <Section><Heading>Reading and writing transformations and partial
      permutations to a file</Heading>
    The functions <Ref Func="ReadGenerators"/> and 
    <Ref Func="WriteGenerators"/> can be used to read or write transformations
    or partial permutations to a file.

  <Section><Heading>Use &R;-classes not &L;-classes</Heading>
    It is harder for &Semigroups; to compute Green's &L;- and
    &H;-classes of a transformation semigroup and the methods used to compute
    with Green's &R;- and &D;-classes are the most efficient in &Semigroups;.
    Thus, if you are computing with a transformation semigroup, wherever
    possible it is advisable to use the commands relating to Green's
    &R;- or &D;-classes rather than those relating to Green's &L;-  or
    &H;-classes. No such difficulties are present when computing with
    semigroups of partial permutations, or subsemigroups of a regular Rees
    0-matrix semigroup over a group.<P/>
    
    The methods in &Semigroups; allow the computation of individual Green's
    classes without the need to compute all the elements of the underlying
    semigroup; see <Ref Oper="GreensRClassOfElementNC"/>.  It is also possible
    to compute all the &R;-classes, the number of elements and test membership
    in a semigroup without computing all the elements; see, for
    example, <Ref Oper="GreensRClasses"/>, <Ref Attr="RClassReps"/>, 
    <Ref Func="IteratorOfRClassReps"/>, <Ref Func="IteratorOfRClasses"/>, or
    <Ref Func="NrRClasses"/>.  This may be useful if you want to study a very
    large semigroup where computing all the elements of the semigroup is
    not feasible.
  </Section>

  <Section><Heading>New methods for existing functions</Heading>
    &Semigroups; contains functions synonymous to some of those define in the
    &GAP; library but, for the sake of convenience, they have abbreviated
    names; further details can be found at the appropriate points in the
    later chapters of the manual. <P/>
    
    &Semigroups; contains different methods for some &GAP; library functions,
    and so you might notice that &GAP; behaves differently when &Semigroups; is
    loaded.  For more details about semigroups in &GAP; or Green's relations in
    particular, see <Ref Sect="Semigroups" BookName="ref"/> or 
    <Ref Sect="Green's Relations" BookName="ref"/>.
