  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YAn important note[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  operations, methods, properties, and functions described in this manual
  only  apply  to  semigroups  of  transformations,  partial permutations, and
  subsemigroups  of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over groups. For the sake
  of  brevity,  we  have  opted  to  say  [12Xsemigroup[112X  rather  than [12Xsemigroup of
  transformations,  partial  permutations,  and  subsemigroups of regular Rees
  0-matrix semigroups over groups[112X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YIntroduction[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis is the manual for the [5XSemigroups[105X package version 1.4. [5XSemigroups[105X 1.4 is
  an   updated   and  expanded  version  of  the  Monoid  package  for  GAP  3
  ([7Xhttp://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html[107X)  by Goetz Pfeiffer, Steve A.
  Linton, Edmund F. Robertson, and Nik Ruskuc and the Monoid package for GAP 4
  ([7Xhttp://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/monoid/index.html[107X)   by  J.  D.
  Mitchell.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSome  of  the  theory  behind  the  algorithms in [5XSemigroups[105X is described in
  [LPRR98] and described in [LPRR02]. Another reference is [LM90]. A reference
  for  free  inverse semigroups is Section 5.10 in [How95]. The functions for:
  finding  a  smaller  degree partial permutation representation of an inverse
  semigroup  are  based on [Sch92]; and finding the maximal subsemigroups of a
  Rees matrix or 0-matrix semigroup are based on Remark 1 in [GGR68].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X  1.4 retains all the functionality of the original [5XMonoid[105X for [5XGAP[105X
  3;  and those functions from [5XMonoid[105X 3.1.4 not involved in the computation of
  automorphism groups of semigroups.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X  1.4  contains more efficient methods than those available in the
  [5XGAP[105X  library  (and in many cases more efficient than any other software) for
  creating  semigroups,  calculating  their  Green's  classes, size, elements,
  group  of units, minimal ideal, and testing membership, finding the inverses
  of a regular element, and factorizing elements over the generators, and many
  more;  see  Chapters  [14X2[114X  and  [14X3[114X.  There  are  also  methods for testing if a
  semigroup satisfies a particular property, such as if it is regular, simple,
  inverse,  completely  regular,  and  a  variety  of  further properties; see
  Chapter  [14X3[114X. Several standard examples of semigroups are provided see Section
  [14X2.5[114X.  [5XSemigroups[105X  also  provides  abbreviated names for some of the commonly
  used  [5XGAP[105X library functions related to semigroups, and functions to read and
  write  collections of transformations or partial permutations to a file; see
  [2XReadGenerators[102X ([14X1.7-2[114X) and [2XWriteGenerators[102X ([14X1.7-3[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere are also functions in [5XSemigroups[105X to define and manipulate free inverse
  semigroups  and  their  elements;  this  part  of the package was written by
  Julius Jonušas.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XSemigroups[105X  package  is  written  [5XGAP[105X  code  and  requires  the [5XOrb[105X and
  [5XIO[105Xpackages.  The  [5XOrb[105X  package  is used to efficiently compute components of
  actions,  which  underpin many of the features of [5XSemigroups[105X. The [5XIO[105X package
  is  used  to  read  and  write transformations and partial permutations to a
  file.  The  [5XGrape[105X package is used in the functions [2XMunnSemigroup[102X ([14X2.5-4[114X) and
  [2XMaximalSubsemigroups[102X  ([14X3.5-11[114X)  but  nowhere else in [5XSemigroups[105X. If [5XGrape[105X is
  not available, then [5XSemigroups[105X can be used as normal with the exception that
  [2XMunnSemigroup[102X ([14X2.5-4[114X) and [2XMaximalSubsemigroups[102X ([14X3.5-11[114X) will not work.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X is still under development, and so some features may not function
  as  expected.  At  the  present time, I do not know of any errors or serious
  issues with [5XSemigroups[105X. If you find a bug or an issue with the package, then
  please let me know by emailing me the details at: [7Xmailto:jdm3@st-and.ac.uk[107X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIt  is  harder  for  [5XSemigroups[105X  to  compute  Green's  [13XL[113X- and [13XH[113X-classes of a
  transformation semigroup and the methods used to compute with Green's [13XR[113X- and
  [13XD[113X-classes  are  the most efficient in [5XSemigroups[105X. Thus, if you are computing
  with  a  transformation  semigroup, wherever possible it is advisable to use
  the  commands relating to Green's [13XR[113X- or [13XD[113X-classes rather than those relating
  to  Green's [13XL[113X- or [13XH[113X-classes. No such difficulties are present when computing
  with  semigroups of partial permutations, or subsemigroups of a regular Rees
  0-matrix semigroup over a group.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  methods  in  [5XSemigroups[105X  allow  the  computation  of individual Green's
  classes  without  the  need  to  compute  all the elements of the underlying
  semigroup;  see  [2XGreensRClassOfElementNC[102X  ([14X3.2-3[114X).  It  is  also possible to
  compute  all  the [13XR[113X-classes, the number of elements and test membership in a
  semigroup   without   computing   all   the   elements;  see,  for  example,
  [2XGreensRClasses[102X  ([14X3.3-1[114X),  [2XRClassReps[102X  ([14X3.3-4[114X), [2XIteratorOfRClassReps[102X ([14X3.3-2[114X),
  [2XIteratorOfRClasses[102X ([14X3.3-3[114X), or [2XNrRClasses[102X ([14X3.4-6[114X). This may be useful if you
  want to study a very large semigroup where computing all the elements of the
  semigroup is not feasible.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X  contains functions synonymous to some of those define in the [5XGAP[105X
  library  but,  for  the  sake  of  convenience, they have abbreviated names;
  further details can be found at the appropriate points in the later chapters
  of the manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X contains different methods for some [5XGAP[105X library functions, and so
  you might notice that [5XGAP[105X behaves differently when [5XSemigroups[105X is loaded. For
  more details about semigroups in [5XGAP[105X or Green's relations in particular, see
