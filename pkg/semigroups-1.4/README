Getting Semigroups
------------------

To get the latest version of this GAP 4.7 package download the archive file 

    semigroups-x.x.tar.gz

from 

    http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups.php

and inside the 'pkg' subdirectory of your GAP 4 installation unpack
semigroups-x.x.tar.gz using:

    gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar

This will create a subdirectory 'semigroups-x.x'.

Installation
------------

It is assumed that you have a working copy of GAP with version number 4.7.1 or
higher.  The  most  up-to-date  version  of  GAP  and instructions on how to
install it can be obtained from the main GAP webpage
  
  http://www.gap-system.org
  
The  following  is  a  summary of the steps that should lead to a successful
installation of Semigroups:

 1.  ensure that the IO package version 4.2 or higher is available. For more
     details go to:

  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html
 
 2.  ensure that the Orb package version 4.6 or higher is available. For more
     details go to:

  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html

     Note that Orb and Semigroups both perform better if Orb is compiled.

 3.  This step is optional: if  you  want  to  be  able  to  calculate the
     Munn semigroup of a semilattice or the maximal subsemigroups of a Rees
     0-matrix semigroup, then make sure that the Grape package version 4.5 or
     higher is available. For more details go to:
  
         http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/
  
     If Grape is not fully installed, then Semigroups can be used as normal
     with  the  exception that MunnSemigroup will not work. The method for
     MaximalSubsemigroups will  work  provided Grape can be loaded, i.e. it is
     not necessary for Grape to be compiled. 


 4.  download the package archive 'semigroups-x.x.tar.gz' from

     http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups.php

 5.  unzip and untar the file 'semigroups-x.x.tar.gz' using
 
        gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar
    
     this should create a directory called 'semigroups-x.x'.

 6.  locate  the  'pkg'  directory  of your GAP directory, which contains the
     directories 'lib', 'doc' and so on. Move the directory 'semigroups-x.x'
     into the 'pkg' directory (if it is not there already).

 7.  start GAP in the usual way.

 8.  type LoadPackage("semigroups");

 9.  compile the documentation by typing 
 
        SemigroupsMakeDoc();
