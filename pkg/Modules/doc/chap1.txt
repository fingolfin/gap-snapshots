  
  [1X1 Introduction[0X
  
  
  [1X1.1 What is the role of the [5XModules[1X package in the [5Xhomalg[1X project?[0X
  
  
  [1X1.1-1 [5XModules[1X provides ...[0X
  
  It provides procedures to construct basic objects in homological algebra:
  
  --    modules (generators, relations)
  
  --    submodules (as images of maps)
  
  --    maps
  
  Beside  these  so-called constructors [5XModules[0m provides [13Xoperations[0m to perform
  computations with these objects. The list of operations includes:
  
  --    resolution of modules
  
  --    images of maps
  
  --    the  functors  [10XHom[0m and [10XTensorProduct[0m ([10XExt[0m and [10XTor[0m are then provided by
        [5Xhomalg[0m)
  
  --    test  if a module is torsion-free, reflexive, projective, stably free,
        free, pure
  
  --    determine   the   rank,   grade,   projective   dimension,  degree  of
        torsion-freeness, and codegree of purity of a module
  
  Using  the  philosophy  of  [5XGAP4[0m, one or more methods are [13Xinstalled[0m for each
  operation,  depending  on  [13Xproperties[0m and [13Xattributes[0m of these objects. These
  properties  and  attributes  can themselves be computed by methods installed
  for this purpose.
  
  
  [1X1.1-2 Rings supported in a sufficient way[0X
  
  Through  out  this  manual  the following terminology is used. We say that a
  computer  algebra  system  "sufficiently  supports" a ring R, if it contains
  procedures  to effectively solve one-sided inhomogeneous linear systems XA=B
  and AX=B with coefficients over R (--> [14X1.1-3[0m).
  
  
  [1X1.1-3 Principal limitation[0X
  
  Note that the solution space of the one-sided finite dimensional system YA=0
  (resp.  AY=0)  over  a  left  (resp.  right) noetherian ring R is a finitely
  generated  left  (resp.  right)  R-module, even if R is not commutative. The
  solution  space of the linear system X_1 A_1 + A_2 X_2 + A_3 X_3 A_4=0 is in
  general  not  an R-module, and worse, in general not finitely generated over
  the  center  of R. [5XModules[0m can only handle homological problems that lead to
  [13Xone  sided[0m  [13Xfinite dimensional[0m homogeneous or inhomogeneous systems over the
  underlying  ring R. Such problems are called problems of [13Xfinite type[0m over R.
  Typically,  the  computation  of  [10XHom[0m(M,N)  of two (even) finitely generated
  modules over a [13Xnon[0mcommutative ring R is generally [13Xnot[0m of finite type over R,
  unless at least one of the two modules is an R-bimodule. Also note that over
  a  commutative  ring  any linear system can be easily brought to a one-sided
  form. For more details see [BR08].
  
  
  [1X1.1-4 Ring dictionaries (technical)[0X
  
  [5XModules[0m uses the so-called [10XhomalgTable[0m, which is stored in the ring, to know
  how to delegate the necessary matrix operations. I.e. the [10XhomalgTable[0m serves
  as  a  small dictionary that enables [5XModules[0m to speak (as much as needed of)
  the  language  of  the  computer algebra system which hosts the ring and the
  matrices.  The  [5XGAP[0m internal ring of integers is the only ring which [5XModules[0m
  endows   with   a   [10XhomalgTable[0m.  Other  packages  like  [5XGaussForHomalg[0m  and
  [5XRingsForHomalg[0m  provide dictionaries for further rings. While [5XGaussForHomalg[0m
  defines  internal  rings  and  matrices,  the package [5XRingsForHomalg[0m enables
  defining  external rings and matrices in a wide range of (external) computer
  algebra  systems  ([5XSingular[0m,  [5XSage[0m,  [5XMacaulay2[0m,  [5XMAGMA[0m,  [5XMaple[0m) by providing
  appropriate dictionaries.
  
  Since these dictionaries are all what is needed to handle matrix operations,
  [5XModules[0m does not distinguish between handling internal and handling external
  matrices.  Even  the physical communication with the external systems is not
  at  all  a  concern of [5XModules[0m. This is the job of the package [5XIO_ForHomalg[0m,
  which  is  based  on the powerful [5XIO[0m package of Max NeunhÃ¶ffer. Furthermore,
  for all structures beyond matrices (from relations, generators, and modules,
  to  functors and spectral sequences) [5XModules[0m no longer distinguishes between
  internal and external.
  
  
  [1X1.1-5 The advantages of the outsourcing concept[0X
  
  Linking  different  systems to achieve one task is a highly attractive idea,
  especially if it helps to avoid reinventing wheels over and over again. This
  was  essential  for [5Xhomalg[0m, since [5XSingular[0m and [5XMAGMA[0m provide the fastest and
  most  advanced  GrÃ¶bner  basis  algorithms,  while  [5XGAP4[0m  is by far the most
  convenient  programming  language to realize complex mathematical structures
  (-->  Appendix  [14X'homalg:  Why  GAP4?'[0m).  Second,  the  implementation of the
  homological   constructions   is   automatically   universal,  since  it  is
  independent  of  where  the  matrices  reside  and  how  the  several matrix
  operations  are  realized.  In particular, [5Xhomalg[0m will always be able to use
  the system with the fastest GrÃ¶bner basis implementation. In this respect is
  [5Xhomalg[0m and all packages that build upon it future proof.
  
  
  [1X1.1-6 Does this mean that [5Xhomalg[1X has only algorithms for the generic case?[0X
  
  No,  on the contrary. There are a lot of specialized algorithms installed in
  [5Xhomalg[0m.  These  algorithms  are  based  on properties and attributes that --
  thanks  to [5XGAP4[0m -- [5Xhomalg[0m objects can carry (--> Appendix [14X'homalg: GAP4 is a
  mathematical  object-oriented  programming  language'[0m):  Not only can [5Xhomalg[0m
  take  the  special nature of the underlying ring into account, it also deals
  with  modules,  complexes, ... depending on their special properties. Still,
  these  special algorithms, like all algorithms in [5Xhomalg[0m, are independent of
  the  computer algebra system which hosts the matrices and which will perform
  the several matrix operations.
  
  
  [1X1.1-7 The principle of least communication (technical)[0X
  
  Linking  different systems can also be highly problematic. The following two
  points are often among the major sources of difficulties:
  
  --    Different systems use different languages:
        It  takes  a  huge  amount  of  time  and  effort to teach systems the
        dialects of each others. These dialects are also rarely fixed forever,
        and  might very well be subject to slight modifications. So the larger
        the dictionary, the more difficult is its maintenance.
  
  --    Data has to be transferred from one system to another:
        Even  if  there  is  a  unified data format, transferring data between
        systems  can  lead to performance losses, especially when a big amount
        of data has to be transferred.
  
  Solving  these  two  difficulties  is an important part of [5XModules[0m's design.
  [5XModules[0m  splits homological computations into two parts. The matrices reside
  in a system which provides fast matrix operations (addition, multiplication,
  bases  and  normal form computations), while the higher structures (modules,
  maps,  complexes,  chain  morphisms, spectral sequences, functors, ...) with
  their  properties,  attributes,  and  algorithms live in [5XGAP4[0m, as the system
  where  one  can  easily  create such complex structures and handle all their
  logical dependencies. With this split there is no need to transfer each sort
  of  data outside of its system. The remaining communication between [5XGAP4[0m and
  the system hosting the matrices gets along with a tiny dictionary. Moreover,
  [5XGAP4[0m,  as  it manages and delegates all computations, also manages the whole
  data flow, while the other system does not even recognize that it is part of
  a bidirectional communication.
  
  The  existence  of  such  a clear cut is certainly to some extent due to the
  special nature of homological computations.
  
  
  [1X1.1-8 Frequently asked questions[0X
  
  --    [12XQ[0m:  Does outsourcing the matrices mean that [5XModules[0m is able to compute
        spectral  sequences,  for  example,  without  ever seeing the matrices
        involved in the computation?
        A: Yes.
  
  --    [12XQ[0m:   Can   [5XModules[0m  profit  from  the  implementation  of  homological
        constructions like [10XHom[0m, [10XExt[0m, ... in [5XSingular[0m?
        A:  No.  This  is  for a lot of reasons incompatible with the idea and
        design (--> [14X1[0m) of [5XModules[0m.
  
  --    [12XQ[0m: Are the external systems involved in the higher algorithms?
        A:  No.  They  host  all  the  matrices  and  do all matrix operations
        delegated  to  them  without  knowing  what  for.  The  meaning of the
        matrices and their logical interrelation is only known to [5XGAP4[0m.
  
  --    [12XQ[0m:  Do  developers  of  packages  building  upon  [5XModules[0m need to know
        anything about the communication with the external systems?
        A:  No,  unless they want to use more features of the external systems
        than  those reflected by [5XModules[0m. For this purpose, developers can use
        the  unified  communication interface provideb by [5XHomalgToCAS[0m. This is
        the interface used by [5XModules[0m.
