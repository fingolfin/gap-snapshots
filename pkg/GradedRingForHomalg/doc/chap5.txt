  
  [1X5 Homogeneous Matrices[0X
  
  The  package  [5XGradedRingForHomalg[0m  defines the classes of graded rings, ring
  elements  and  homogeneous matrices over such rings. These three objects can
  be  used as data structures defined in [5XMatricesForHomalg[0m on which the [5Xhomalg[0m
  project can rely to do homological computations over graded rings.
  
  The  graded  rings  most  prominently  can  be  used with methods known from
  general  [5Xhomalg[0m  rings. The methods for doing the computations are presented
  in the appendix ([14XB[0m), since they are not for external use. The new attributes
  and operations are documented here.
  
  Since   the  objects  inplemented  here  are  representations  from  objects
  elsewhere  in the [5Xhomalg[0m project (i.e. [5XMatricesForHomalg[0m), we want to stress
  that there are many other operations in [5XMatricesForHomalg[0m, which can be used
  in  connection  with  the ones presented here. A few of them can be found in
  the examples and the appendix of this documentation.
