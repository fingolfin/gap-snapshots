  
  [1X2 Installation of the [5XGradedRingForHomalg[1X Package[0X
  
  To  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the [5XGAP[0m
  [11Xpkg[0m directory. [5XGradedRingForHomalg[0m also needs the package [5Xhomalg[0m.
  
  By  default  the  [5XGradedRingForHomalg[0m package is not automatically loaded by
  [5XGAP[0m when it is installed. You must load the package with
  [10XLoadPackage("GradedRingForHomalg");[0m
  before its functions become available.
  
  Please,  send  me us e-mail if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions,
  etc.  concerning  this  package.  Also,  we  would  be pleased to hear about
  applications of this package.
