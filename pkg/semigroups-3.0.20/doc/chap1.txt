  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YIntroduction[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  is  the  manual  for  the  [5XSemigroups[105X  package for [5XGAP[105X version 3.0.20.
  [5XSemigroups[105X  3.0.20  is  a distant descendant of the Monoid package for GAP 3
  ([7Xhttp://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html[107X)  by Goetz Pfeiffer, Steve A.
  Linton, Edmund F. Robertson, and Nik Ruskuc.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XSemigroups[105X  3.0.20  contains  efficient  methods  for  creating  semigroups,
  monoids,  inverse  semigroups  and  their  ideals, calculating their Green's
  structure,  size,  elements,  group  of  units,  minimal  ideal, and testing
  membership,  finding  the  inverses  of  a  regular element, and factorizing
  elements over the generators, and much more; see below for more details.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are methods for finding: congruences of semigroups, the normalizer of
  a  semigroup  in  a  permutation group (using the method from [ABMN10]), the
  maximal  subsemigroups of a finite semigroup (based on [GGR68] and described
  in  [DMW16]),  smaller  degree partial permutation representations (based on
  [Sch92])  and  the  character  table  of  an  inverse  semigroup.  There are
  functions  for  producing  pictures  of the Green's structure of a semigroup
  (inspired  by  [5Xsgpviz[105X),  and  for  drawing  graphical representations of the
  elements of certain semigroups.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YMany standard examples of semigroups and classes of semigroups are provided;
  see  Section  [14X8[114X.  [5XSemigroups[105X  also  provides  functions  to  read  and write
  collections  of  elements  of  a  semigroup  to  a  file; see [2XReadGenerators[102X
  ([14X19.1-1[114X) and [2XWriteGenerators[102X ([14X19.1-2[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  functions  in  [5XSemigroups[105X  to define and manipulate free inverse
  semigroups  and  free  bands; this part of the package was written by Julius
  Jonu≈°as; see Chapters [14X10[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFrom  Version  3.0.0,  [5XSemigroups[105X  includes  a copy of the [5Xlibsemigroups[105X C++
  library which contains an implementation of the Froidure-Pin Algorithm.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[12XMinor  note  of  caution[112X: [5XSemigroups[105X contains different methods for some [5XGAP[105X
  library functions, and so you might notice that [5XGAP[105X behaves differently when
  [5XSemigroups[105X  is  loaded.  For more details about semigroups in [5XGAP[105X or Green's
  relations  in particular, see [14X'Reference: Semigroups'[114X or [14X'Reference: Green's
  Relations'[114X.[133X

  issue tracker ([7Xhttp://bitbucket.org/james-d-mitchell/semigroups/issues[107X).[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YOverview[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis manual is organised as follows:[133X
  
  [8XPart I: generators[108X
