<Abstract>
The &gpd; package for &GAP;4 provides functions for 
the computation with groupoids (categories with every arrow invertible) 
and their morphisms; for graphs of groups, and graphs of groupoids.
<P/>
It provides normal forms for Free Products with Amalgamation 
and for HNN-extensions when the initial groups have rewrite systems 
and the subgroups have finite index.
<P/>
The &gpd; package was originally implemented in 2000 
(as <Package>GraphGpd</Package>) 
when the first author was studying for a Ph.D. in Bangor.
<P/>
Version 1.07 was released in July 2011, to be tested with &GAP; 4.5. 
Version 1.15 came out with the first release of &GAP; 4.5 in June 2012. 
The aim is that this version should be submitted for official 
acceptance as a &GAP; package. 
The latest version is &VERSION; of January 25th 2013, prepared for  &GAP; 4.6.  
<P/> 
The package now includes the more basic structure of <E>magma with objects</E>.  
It has been released to coincide with the publication of <Cite Key="AlWe" />. 
This version does not implement all the constructions introduced in the 
paper, so a new version will be released as soon as possible. 
<P/>
Bug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome.
