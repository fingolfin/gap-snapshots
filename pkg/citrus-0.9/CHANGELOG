0.8 -> 0.9 

            renamed the function for creating the semigroup of order-preserving
            transformations on an n-chain from O to OrderEndomorphisms after it
            was pointed out that it is not sensible to have function names with
            one character. Also made some minor adjustments to the manual.

0.7 -> 0.8 
            
            minor changes due to incompatibility with Smallsemi 0.6.4 which 
            caused some test files to fail when Nilmat was loaded after Citrus.
            The clashes and the failed test were caused by various properties
            being declared for IsTransformationSemigroup rather than
            IsSemigroup. 

0.6 -> 0.7 
            the most major change is the introduction of special methods for
            partial permutations and inverse semigroups. So that these methods
            are efficient, a GAP kernel component (in C) has also been
            introduced for various low-level computations with partial
            permutations. Essentially all functions previously available for
            transformation semigroups are now available for inverse semigroups
            of partial permutations. The manual has been expanded and
            reorganised, some standard examples have been included (semigroups
            of order preserving transformations or partial permutations, the
            symmetric inverse semigroup, the full matrix semigroup over a
            finite field), the endomorphism monoids of the non-abelian groups
            with at most 64 elements have been included in the catalogues of
            examples, the functions InjectionPrincipalFactor,
            IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup, and PrincipalFactor, and some
            specific properties and attributes of inverse semigroups have been
            introduced (such as IsFactorisableSemigroup and
            PrimitiveIdempotents).

0.5 -> 0.6 

            fixed a bug relating to the creation of transformation semigroups 
            using MagmaByGenerators. Also added the global variable 
            CitrusOptionsRec containing the default values of the options used 
            by Citrus when creating a semigroup. 

0.4 -> 0.5

            major changes are: the documentation has been further revised,
            functions for creating semigroups and monoids with certain
            options have been introduced, several functions have had the word
            `Greens' removed from their names to reduce the length, the
            operation ClosureSemigroup has been introduced, the functions
            ReadCitrus and WriteCitrus for reading and writing transformations
            to a file have been introduced, several catalogues of examples of
            transformation semigroups are now included in the examples
            directory, methods for creating a Green's class inside another
            Green's class have been included (such as an R-class of a D-class
            or an H-class of an L-class), the hash functions used for
            transformations etc have been improved. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:

            AntiIsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a trans. semigroup),
            IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigp, IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup
            (for a perm. gp), IsomorphismTransformationMonoid (for a perm. gp),
            NrElementsOfRank.

0.3 -> 0.4

            major changes are: the documentation has been updated, some changes
            to core functions for R-classes/image orbits have resulted in a 
            performance improvement, there is a method for the operation
            Factorization allowing an arbitrary element of a transformation
            semigroup to be expressed as a product of the generators. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:
            
            OrbSCC, OrbSCCLookup, OrbSCCTruthTable, 
            ReverseSchreierTreeOfSCC, SchreierTreeOfSCC,
            IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a perm. gp). 

0.2 -> 0.3 
            
            fixed a critical (but rare) bug in AddToOrbitsOfKernels that caused
            computations relating to D-classes, H-classes, or L-classes to
            return incorrect answers in some cases. 

0.1 -> 0.2  
            updated the method for \^ for a transformation and perm so that it
            is more efficient than the library method, same for \* for a perm 
            and transformation. New method for StructureDescription of a
            Brandt semigroup, and IsSubset for a trans. semigroup and trans.
            coll. 
    
            fixed bugs in IndexPeriodOfTransformation (it returned incorrect
            results) and AsPermutation. Also reduce hash table lengths so that 
            Citrus uses less memory. Fixed bug that triggered an infinite
            loop when trying to find elements of a trivial trans. semigroup.  

            added the functions CitrusDefaultMem, CitrusHiMem, CitrusLoMem,
            CitrusVeryLoMem, IsBrandtSemigroup, IsLeftSimple,
            IsMonogenicSemigroup, IsRightSimple, IsZeroRectangularBand,
            IsZeroSimpleSemigroup.
