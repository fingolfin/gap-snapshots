      Introduction
    </Heading>

    This is the manual for the &Semigroups; package for &GAP; version &VERSION;.
    &Semigroups; &VERSION; is a distant descendant of the
    <URL Text = "Monoid package for GAP 3">
      http://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html</URL> by Goetz Pfeiffer,
    Steve A. Linton, Edmund F. Robertson, and Nik Ruskuc.<P/>

    &Semigroups; &VERSION; contains efficient methods for creating semigroups,
    monoids, inverse semigroups and their ideals, calculating their Green's
    structure, size, elements, group of units, minimal ideal, and testing
    membership, finding the inverses of a regular element, and factorizing
    elements over the generators, and much more; see below for more details.
    <P/>

    There are methods for finding: congruences of semigroups, the normalizer of
    a semigroup in a permutation group (using the method from <Cite Key =
      "Araujo2010aa"/>), the maximal subsemigroups of a finite semigroup (based
    on <Cite Key = "Graham1968aa"/> and described in <Cite Key =
      "Donoven2016aa"/>), smaller degree partial permutation representations
    (based on <Cite Key = "Schein1992aa"/>) and the character table of an
    inverse semigroup.  There are functions for producing pictures of the
    Green's structure of a semigroup (inspired by 
    <Alt Not='Text'><URL
        Text='sgpviz'>https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sgpviz.html</URL></Alt><Alt
      Only='Text'><Package>sgpviz</Package></Alt>), and for drawing graphical
    representations of the elements of certain semigroups. <P/>

    Many standard examples of semigroups and classes of semigroups are
    provided; see Section <Ref Sect = "Standard examples"/>.  &Semigroups; also
    provides functions to read and write collections of elements of a semigroup
    to a file; see <Ref Func = "ReadGenerators"/> and <Ref Func =
      "WriteGenerators"/>.
    <P/>

    There are functions in &Semigroups; to define and manipulate free
    inverse semigroups and free bands; this part of the package was written
    by Julius Jonu&#353;as; see Chapters <Ref Chap = "Free objects"/>.
    <P/>

    From Version 3.0.0, &Semigroups; includes a copy of the &libsemigroups; C++
    library which contains an implementation of the Froidure-Pin Algorithm. 
    <P/>

    <B>Minor note of caution</B>: &Semigroups; contains different methods for
    some &GAP; library functions, and so you might notice that &GAP; behaves
    differently when &Semigroups; is loaded.  For more details about semigroups
    in &GAP; or Green's relations in particular, see <Ref Sect = "Semigroups"
      BookName = "ref"/> or <Ref Sect = "Green's Relations" BookName = "ref"/>.

      Overview

    This manual is organised as follows: 
    <List>
      <Mark>Part I: generators</Mark> 
      <Item>
        the different types of generators that are introduced in &Semigroups;
        are described in Chapters <Ref Chap = "Bipartitions and blocks"/>, 
        <Ref Chap = "Partitioned binary relations (PBRs)"/>, and 
        <Ref Chap = "Matrices over semirings"/>. These include 
        <Ref Func="Bipartition"/>, <Ref Oper="PBR"/>, and
        <Ref Oper="Matrix" Label="for a filter and a matrix"/>, which
        supplement those already defined in the &GAP; library, such as
        <Ref Oper="Transformation" Label="for an image list" BookName="ref"/> or
        <Ref Oper="PartialPerm" Label="for a domain and image" BookName="ref"/>.
      </Item>

      <Mark>Part II: semigroups and ideals</Mark>
      <Item>
        functions and operations for creating semigroups, monoids, and their
        ideals, in general, and various options, are described
        in Chapters <Ref Chap = "Creating semigroups and monoids"/> and 
        <Ref Chap = "Ideals"/>.
      </Item>
      
      <Mark>Part III: standard examples and constructions</Mark>
      <Item>
        standard examples of semigroups, such as <Ref Oper =
          "FullBooleanMatMonoid"/> or <Ref Oper =
          "UniformBlockBijectionMonoid"/>, are described in 
        Chapter <Ref Chap = "Standard examples"/>, and standard constructions,
        such as <Ref Func = "TrivialSemigroup"/>, <Ref Func =
          "RightZeroSemigroup"/>, are described in Chapter 
        <Ref Chap = "Standard constructions"/>.
      </Item>
      
      <Mark>Part IV: further classes of semigroups and monoids</Mark>
      <Item>
        free objects in the categories of inverse semigroups, and bands, are
        described in Chapter <Ref Chap = "Free objects"/>, and graph inverse
        semigroups, which are a generalisation of polycyclic monoids, are
        described in Chapter <Ref Chap = "GraphInverseSemigroups"/>.
      </Item>

      <Mark>Part V: the structure of a semigroup or monoid</Mark>
      <Item>
        the functionality of the &Semigroups; package for determining various
        structural properties of a given semigroup or monoid are described in
        Chapters <Ref Chap = "Green's relations"/>,  
        <Ref Chap = "Attributes and operations for semigroups"/>, 
        and 
        <Ref Chap = "Properties of semigroups"/>.
        Attributes and properties specific to inverse semigroups are described in
        Chapter
        <Ref Chap = "Properties and attributes specific to inverse semigroups"/>.
      </Item>
      
      <Mark>Part VI: congruences, quotients, and homomorphisms</Mark>
      <Item>
        methods for creating and manipulating congruences and homomorphisms are
