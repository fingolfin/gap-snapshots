    fields. WARNING: Wrong results were produced by version 2.0!


==========================
 Changes from 1.8 -> 2.0:
==========================

  - Improve implementation of MinimalPolynomialOfMatrixMC and use it
    as a method for MinimalPolynomial for row list matrices.
    Document it for the first time.
  - Completely change build setup to use automake/autoconf/libtool as
    done in the IO package.


==========================
 Changes from 1.7 -> 1.8:
==========================

  - Slightly improved minimal polynomial routine by suggestion of
    referee.
  - Use C-Hashfunction of orb 3.0 if it is there.
  - Many optimisations for GF2
  - Faster ScalarProduct for GF2
  - Fast EntryOfMatrixProduct for prime fields
  - Fixed configure script to work with GAP 4.5 without breaking 4.4.
  - Fixed a bug with zero length matrices introduced after 1.7
  - Added a Length method for semi echelonised bases
  - Documented the Vectors operation for semi echelonised bases
  - Put revision 402 as version 1.8 on the web


==========================
 Changes from 1.6 -> 1.7:
==========================

  - Introduce filters for cmats and cvecs to distinguish cases of q=p
    and q <= MAXSIZE_GF_INTERNAL.
  - Kernel method for cmat row access
  - Operation ScalarProductsRows with kernel method for prime fields
    used for condensation
  - Fixed infinite recursion in matrix multiplication because of
    Winograd method.
  - Fixed problem of polynomial factorisation over "DefaultField"
    instead of BaseDomain in Minimal and Characteristic polynomial
    routines.
  - New method for SumIntersectionMat for cmats. 
  - Use constructors for new objects in new interface, implement them.
  - Change all addresses to St Andrews.
  - Require GAP >= 4.4.9
  - Tune vector matrices interface and polish implementation.
  - Added a pickling/unpickling method for semi echelon basis.
  - Quite a few little changes to the vector/matrix interface
    after discussions in Braunschweig.
  - Make TraceMat compatible with GAP4R4.
  - Added matobjplist.g* from the dev library for compatibility with 4r4.
  - Put revision 324 as version 1.7 on the web.


==========================
 Changes from 1.5 -> 1.6:
==========================

  - Improve MinimalPolynomialMC, change calling convention.
  - Fixed a dangerous bug in matrix multiplication using the
    memory-saving Winograd trick.
  - Better Value method for CMats (do nothing a human would not also do)
  - Put AddMatrix and MultMatrix into interface and implement it for cmats
  - Put revision 298 as version 1.6 on the web.


==========================
 Changes from 1.4 -> 1.5:
==========================

  - Improve usage of grease, in particular for level 1 for 2 < q < 257
  - Improve FILL_GREASE_TAB by using trick coming from analysis: we only
    have to multiply a few times by the primitive root, not by powers of it.
  - Fixed a serious bug in SemiEchelonBasisMutableTX which occurred if
    the first row of the matrix was zero.
  - New operation CompanionMatrix (not yet documented)
  - GreaseCalibration for different machines (not yet documented)
  - Winograd trick for multiplication, corresponding calibration function
  - Put copyright and licensing information in all files.
  - Add version number to archive name, fixed some things in PackageInfo.g.
  - Put revision 280 as version 1.5 on the web.


==========================
 Changes from 1.3 -> 1.4:
==========================

  - Adjust to new buffered I/O.
  - New operation ChangeBaseDomain with methods for cvecs and cmats.
  - Put revision 212 as version 1.4 on the web.


==========================
 Changes from 1.2 -> 1.3:
==========================

  - change nearly everything to the new vector/matrix interface
  - implement new Intersection functionality no longer using Zassenhaus
  - allow for more than one package with a C-part
  - added test/polynomials.g to check characteristic and minimal polynomials
  - added Memory for cvecs and cmats and to interface
