0.999 -> 0.9999
            This is the final release of Citrus (the package will be renamed
            Semigroups in the next release since the scope of the package has
            expanded to include more types of semigroups than just those of
            transformations and partial permutations). 

            A minor release fixing several bugs relating to inverse semigroups
            of partial permutations pointed out by partcipants at the
            University of St Andrews Research for Undergraduates Summer School
            in July 2012.  Most notably by Demi Allen, Casey Donoven, Rhiannon
            Dougall, Robert Hancock, and Wilf Wilson. More specifically,
            SymmetricInverseSemigroup(n) returned an incorrect answer when n=1
            or n=2, \in for the empty mapping and an inverse semigroup of
            partial perms sometimes incorrectly returned false, some harmless
            compiler warnings were displayed when using more recent versions of
            gcc, NaturalLeqPP sometimes returned the incorrect value, there was
            no method for IsInverseSemigroup or IsInverseMonoid for a semigroup
            of partial perms. 

0.99 -> 0.999 
            A minor release fixing several bugs relating to partial
            permutations and monoids thereof, pointed out by Jack Schmidt.
            More specifically, MultiplicativeZero sometimes incorrectly
            returned fail for a inverse semigroup of partial permutations,
            sometimes PartialPerm incorrectly returned fail when given a dense
            range as an argument, sometimes the size of an inverse monoid was 1
            more than the correct value, and RestrictedPP sometimes failed when
            it should not have. 

0.9 -> 0.99 
            another minor release. Specific changes were: removed the
            declaration of SmallGeneratingSet for IsSemigroup since it appears
            not to be used and caused a warning to be shown when rcwa was
            loaded after Citrus. Added a new abstract to the PackageInfo.g
            file, and the documentation, and updated the webpages, in
            particular so that the html version of the manual is linked to that
            on the GAP webpage and the links to other manuals work. 

0.8 -> 0.9 
            renamed the function for creating the semigroup of order-preserving
            transformations on an n-chain from O to OrderEndomorphisms after it
            was pointed out that it is not sensible to have function names with
            one character. Also made some minor adjustments to the manual.

0.7 -> 0.8 
            minor changes due to incompatibility with Smallsemi 0.6.4 which 
            caused some test files to fail when Nilmat was loaded after Citrus.
            The clashes and the failed test were caused by various properties
            being declared for IsTransformationSemigroup rather than
            IsSemigroup. 

0.6 -> 0.7 
            the most major change is the introduction of special methods for
            partial permutations and inverse semigroups. So that these methods
            are efficient, a GAP kernel component (in C) has also been
            introduced for various low-level computations with partial
            permutations. Essentially all functions previously available for
            transformation semigroups are now available for inverse semigroups
            of partial permutations. The manual has been expanded and
            reorganised, some standard examples have been included (semigroups
            of order preserving transformations or partial permutations, the
            symmetric inverse semigroup, the full matrix semigroup over a
            finite field), the endomorphism monoids of the non-abelian groups
            with at most 64 elements have been included in the catalogues of
            examples, the functions InjectionPrincipalFactor,
            IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup, and PrincipalFactor, and some
            specific properties and attributes of inverse semigroups have been
            introduced (such as IsFactorisableSemigroup and
            PrimitiveIdempotents).

0.5 -> 0.6 
            fixed a bug relating to the creation of transformation semigroups 
            using MagmaByGenerators. Also added the global variable 
            CitrusOptionsRec containing the default values of the options used 
            by Citrus when creating a semigroup. 

0.4 -> 0.5
            major changes are: the documentation has been further revised,
            functions for creating semigroups and monoids with certain
            options have been introduced, several functions have had the word
            `Greens' removed from their names to reduce the length, the
            operation ClosureSemigroup has been introduced, the functions
            ReadCitrus and WriteCitrus for reading and writing transformations
            to a file have been introduced, several catalogues of examples of
            transformation semigroups are now included in the examples
            directory, methods for creating a Green's class inside another
            Green's class have been included (such as an R-class of a D-class
            or an H-class of an L-class), the hash functions used for
            transformations etc have been improved. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:

            AntiIsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a trans. semigroup),
            IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigp, IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup
            (for a perm. gp), IsomorphismTransformationMonoid (for a perm. gp),
            NrElementsOfRank.

0.3 -> 0.4
            major changes are: the documentation has been updated, some changes
            to core functions for R-classes/image orbits have resulted in a 
            performance improvement, there is a method for the operation
            Factorization allowing an arbitrary element of a transformation
            semigroup to be expressed as a product of the generators. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:
            
            OrbSCC, OrbSCCLookup, OrbSCCTruthTable, 
            ReverseSchreierTreeOfSCC, SchreierTreeOfSCC,
            IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a perm. gp). 

0.2 -> 0.3 
            fixed a critical (but rare) bug in AddToOrbitsOfKernels that caused
            computations relating to D-classes, H-classes, or L-classes to
            return incorrect answers in some cases. 

0.1 -> 0.2  
            updated the method for \^ for a transformation and perm so that it
            is more efficient than the library method, same for \* for a perm 
            and transformation. New method for StructureDescription of a
            Brandt semigroup, and IsSubset for a trans. semigroup and trans.
            coll. 
    
            fixed bugs in IndexPeriodOfTransformation (it returned incorrect
            results) and AsPermutation. Also reduce hash table lengths so that 
            Citrus uses less memory. Fixed bug that triggered an infinite
            loop when trying to find elements of a trivial trans. semigroup.  

            added the functions CitrusDefaultMem, CitrusHiMem, CitrusLoMem,
            CitrusVeryLoMem, IsBrandtSemigroup, IsLeftSimple,
            IsMonogenicSemigroup, IsRightSimple, IsZeroRectangularBand,
            IsZeroSimpleSemigroup.
