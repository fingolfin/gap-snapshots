            <Func Name="ArcPresentationToKnottedOneComplex" Arg="P"/>
            <Description>
                <P/>
                Inputs an arc presentation <M>P</M> corresponding to some link.
                The output is an inclusion of regular CW-complexes <M>f: Y \hookrightarrow X</M> where
                <M>Y</M> is homeomorphic to a (disjoint union of) circle(s) and <M>X</M> is 
                homeomorphic to the closed 3-ball.

            <Func Name="RegularCWMapToCWSubcomplex" Arg="f"/>
            <Description>
                <P/>
                The inverse of the below function. This function inputs a strictly
                cellular map <M>f:Y \rightarrow X</M> of regular CW-complexes.
                It outputs a list <M>[X,S]</M> corresponding to the CW-subcomplex <M>f(Y)</M>. Here, <M>S</M>
                denotes a list of lists of positive integers indicating the the location of each cell of <M>f(Y)</M>
                in <M>X</M>.

            <Func Name="CWSubcomplexToRegularCWMap" Arg="XS"/>
            <Description>
                <P/>
                The inverse of the above function. This function inputs a CW-subcomplex <M>[X,S]</M>
                and outputs the associated inclusion of regular CW-complexes <M>f: Y \hookrightarrow X</M>.

                <P/>
                Inputs two CW-subcomplexes <M>[X,S]</M> and <M>[X,S']</M> and returns the CW-subcomplex
                <M>[X,S'']</M> corresponding to their intersection.

                <P/>
                Inputs a CW-subcomplex <M>[X,S]</M> and returns a list <M>[[X,S_1], \ldots, [X,S_n]]</M>

                <P/>
                Inputs a regular CW-subcomplex <M>X</M> and two integers <M>k \geq 0, i > 1</M>.
                The output is a CW-subcomplex <M>[X,S]</M> arising as the topological closure of
                the <M>i</M>th <M>k</M>-cell <M>e^k_i \subset X</M>.

                <P/>
                Inputs a non-CW cell complex <M>B</M>, an integer <M>k \geq 0</M> and two lists of 
                positive integers <M>b</M> and <M>c</M>. This function adds to <M>B</M> a single
                <M>k</M>-cell <M>e^k_i</M> whose boundary <M>(k-1)</M>-cells are determined by <M>b</M> and
                whose coboundary <M>(k+1)</M>-cells are determined by <M>c</M>.
