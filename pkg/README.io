      README file for the `IO' GAP4 package (Max Neunhoeffer)
     =========================================================
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download the
archive file
    io-x.x.tar.gz
or
    io-x.x.tar.bz2
or
    io-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    gunzip io-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf io-x.x.tar
or
    bzip2 -d io-x.x.tar.bz2; tar xvf io-x.x.tar
or
    unzip -x io-x.x.zip
respectively.

Do this in a directory called 'pkg', preferably (but not necessarily)
in the 'pkg' subdirectory of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a
subdirectory called 'io'.

To install this package do

    cd io
    ./configure

If you installed io in another directory than the usual 'pkg'
subdirectory, do
    ./configure --with-gaproot=path
where 'path' is a path to the main GAP root directory.
See
    ./configure --help
for further options.

Afterwards call 'make' to compile a binary file.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you must execute this
configure/make step on each of the architectures giving the correct
CONFIGNAME on the command line of 'configure'.

The package  will not work without  this  step.

If you installed the package in another 'pkg' directory than the standard
'pkg' directory in your GAP 4 installation, then you have to add the path
to the directory containing your 'pkg' directory to GAP's list of directories.
This can be done by starting GAP with the '-l' command line option
followed by the name of the directory and a semicolon. Then your directory
is prepended to the list of directories searched. Otherwise the package 
is not found by GAP. Of course, you can add this option to your GAP
startup script.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recompiling the documentation is possible by the command `gap makedoc.g'
in the IO directory. But this should not be necessary.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
