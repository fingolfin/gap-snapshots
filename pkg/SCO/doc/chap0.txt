  [1XAbstract[0m
  This document explains the primary uses of the [5XSCO[0m package. Included in this
  manual  is a documented list of the most important methods and functions you
  will  need.  For  the  theoretical  basis of this package please refer to my
  diploma thesis and the corresponding paper (work in progress; [G√∂r08a]).

  [1XAcknowledgements[0m
  The [5XSCO[0m package would not have been possible without the theoretical work by
  I.  Moerdijk  and  D. A. Pronk concerning simplicial cohomology of orbifolds
  [MP99].  Many  thanks  to  these  two,  as  well  as Mohamed Barakat and the
  Lehrstuhl  B  f√ºr Mathematik at RWTH Aachen University in general. It should
  be  noted  that  [5XSCO[0m  in  its  current functionality is dependent on the [5XGAP[0m
  package [5Xhomalg[0m by M. Barakat [BR08], as it relies on [5Xhomalg[0m to do the actual
  computations. This manual was created with the help of the [5XGAPDoc[0m package by
  M. Neunh√∂ffer and F. L√ºbeck.
