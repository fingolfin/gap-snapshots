<Heading>What is the idea of the &AutoDoc; package?</Heading>

This package is supposed to help creating documentations for &GAP; packages.
It makes it possible to create documentation without writing .xml. It is not in any way a
substitution for GAPDoc, but needs it to compile it's output.

   <Heading> How to use AutoDoc </Heading>
To use AutoDoc to create your documentations, just use the *WithDocumentation methods to
install your methods with documentations. When you want to create the documentation,
use the CreateAutomaticDocumentation method to create the documentation xml files.
After that, you need to process them with GAPDoc to get the usual documentation.
The Package ToolsForHomalg is completely documented with AutoDoc, so you can
find an example for the usage there.
