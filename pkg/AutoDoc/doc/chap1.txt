  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YWhat is the idea of the [5XAutoDoc[105X[101X[1X package?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  is supposed to help creating documentations for [5XGAP[105X packages.
  It makes it possible to create documentation without writing .xml. It is not
  in any way a substitution for GAPDoc, but needs it to compile it's output.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YHow to use AutoDoc[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo   use   AutoDoc   to   create   your   documentations,   just   use   the
  *WithDocumentation methods to install your methods with documentations. When
  you  want  to create the documentation, use the CreateAutomaticDocumentation
  method  to  create  the  documentation  xml  files.  After that, you need to
  process  them  with  GAPDoc  to  get  the  usual  documentation. The Package
  ToolsForHomalg  is  completely  documented  with AutoDoc, so you can find an
  example for the usage there.[133X
