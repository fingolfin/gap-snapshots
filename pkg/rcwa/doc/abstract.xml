<Abstract>

&RCWA; is a package for &GAP;&nbsp;4. It provides implementations of
algorithms and methods for computing in certain infinite permutation groups
acting on the set of integers. This package can be used to investigate the
following types of groups and many more:

<List>

  <Item>
    Finite groups, and certain divisible torsion groups which they
    embed into.
  </Item>

  <Item>
    Free groups of finite rank.
  </Item>

  <Item>
    Free products of finitely many finite groups.
  </Item>

  <Item>
    Direct products of the above groups.
  </Item>

  <Item>
    Wreath products of the above groups with finite groups and
    with&nbsp;(&ZZ;,+).
  </Item>

  <Item>
    Subgroups of any such groups.
  </Item>

</List>

Among these groups there are finitely generated groups which are
not finitely presented, and such with unsolvable membership problem.
Further, any finite group embeds into some divisible torsion group
which &RCWA; can deal with. <P/>

With the help of this package, the author has found a countable simple
group which is generated by involutions interchanging disjoint residue
classes of the integers and which all the above groups embed into --
see&nbsp;<Cite Key="Kohl09"/>. <P/>
