  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YMotivation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  development  of this package has originally been inspired by the famous
  [22X3n+1[122X-Conjecture,  which  asserts  that  iterated  application of the [13XCollatz
  mapping[113X[133X

                                        | n/2 if n even,
                 T:  Z -> Z,   n  |->  <
                                        | (3n+1)/2 if n odd

  [33X[0;0Yto any given positive integer eventually yieldsÂ 1 (cf.Â [Lag06]).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSo  far,  no  attempts have been made to investigate the structure of groups
  whose  elements  are  permutations which are [21Xsimilar to the Collatz mapping[121X,
  i.e. [13Xresidue-class-wise affine[113X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter  having  investigated  these  groups for a couple of years, the author
  felt that this is a gap which is worth to be filled.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YPurpose of this package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YMost  research  in  computational  group  theory  focuses  mainly  on finite
  permutation groups, matrix groups, finitely presented groups, polycyclically
  presented groups and automata groups. For details, we refer toÂ [HEO05].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe purpose of this package is twofold:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOn the one hand, it deals with another large class of groups which are
        accessible  to  computational  methods,  and  it therefore extends the
        range of groups which can be dealt with by means of computation.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOn   the   other,   residue-class-wise  affine  groups  appear  to  be
        interesting  mathematical objects in their own right, and this package
        is  intended  to  serve  as a tool to obtain a better understanding of
        their  rich  and often complicated group theoretical and combinatorial
        structure.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YGroups which this package can deal with[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  principle  this  package permits to construct and investigate all groups
  which  have  faithful  representations  as residue-class-wise affine groups.
  Among  many  others, the following groups and their subgroups belong to this
  class:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFinite  groups,  and certain divisible torsion groups which they embed
        into.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFree groups of finite rank.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFree  products  of finitely many finite groups, thus in particular the
        modular group PSL(2,â„¤).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDirect products of the above groups.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWreath products of the above groups with finite groups and withÂ (â„¤,+).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  list  permits  already  to  conclude that there are finitely generated
  residue-class-wise affine groups which do not have finite presentations, and
  such with algorithmically unsolvable membership problem. However the list is
  certainly  by  far  not  exhaustive,  and  using  this package it is easy to
  construct groups of types which are not mentioned there.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe group CT(â„¤) which is generated by all [13Xclass transpositions[113X ofÂ â„¤ -- these
  are   involutions  which  interchange  two  disjoint  residue  classes,  see
  [2XClassTransposition[102X  ([14X2.2-3[114X)  -- is a simple group which has subgroups of all
  types  listed  above.  It  is countable, but it has an uncountable series of
  simple subgroups which is parametrized by the sets of odd primes.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YProofs  of  most  of  the  results  mentioned  here can be found inÂ [Koh10].
  Descriptions  of  a part of the algorithms and methods which are implemented
  in this package can be found inÂ [Koh08a].[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YScope of this package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  can be applied in various ways to various different problems,
  and  it  is  simply  not possible to say what can be found out with its help
  about  which  groups.  The  best  way to get an idea about this is likely to
  experiment with the examples discussed in this manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOf course this package often does not provide an out-of-the-box solution for
  a  given  problem.  Quite often it is possible to find an answer for a given
  question by using an interactive trial-and-error approach.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWith  substantial  help  of  this  package, the author has found the results
  mentioned  in  SectionÂ [14X1.3[114X. Interactive sessions with this package have also
  lead  to the development of most of the algorithms which are now implemented
  in  it. Just to mention one example, developing the factorization method for
  residue-class-wise affine permutations (seeÂ [2XFactorizationIntoCSCRCT[102X ([14X2.5-1[114X))
  solely by means of theory would likely have been very hard.[133X
