<h3>1 <span class="Heading">About the RCWA Package</span></h3>

<p><a id="X816FA3667FFEDC3F" name="X816FA3667FFEDC3F"></a></p>

<h4>1.1 <span class="Heading">Motivation</span></h4>

<p>The development of this package has originally been inspired by the famous <span class="SimpleMath">3n+1</span>-Conjecture, which asserts that iterated application of the <em>Collatz mapping</em></p>

<p><center> <img src = "collatz.png" width = "342" height = "63" alt = "T: Z -> Z, n |-> (n/2 if n even, (3n+1)/2 if n odd)"/> </center></p>

<p>to any given positive integer eventually yields 1 (cf. <a href="chapBib.html#biBLagarias06">[Lag06]</a>).</p>

<p>So far, no attempts have been made to investigate the structure of groups whose elements are permutations which are "similar to the Collatz mapping", i.e. <em>residue-class-wise affine</em>.</p>

<p>After having investigated these groups for a couple of years, the author felt that this is a gap which is worth to be filled.</p>

<p><a id="X78FE3F9D80DB633E" name="X78FE3F9D80DB633E"></a></p>

<h4>1.2 <span class="Heading">Purpose of this package</span></h4>

<p>Most research in computational group theory focuses mainly on finite permutation groups, matrix groups, finitely presented groups, polycyclically presented groups and automata groups. For details, we refer to <a href="chapBib.html#biBHoltEickOBrien05">[HEO05]</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of this package is twofold:</p>


<ul>
<li><p>On the one hand, it deals with another large class of groups which are accessible to computational methods, and it therefore extends the range of groups which can be dealt with by means of computation.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On the other, residue-class-wise affine groups appear to be interesting mathematical objects in their own right, and this package is intended to serve as a tool to obtain a better understanding of their rich and often complicated group theoretical and combinatorial structure.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="X82190FB67F7F3325" name="X82190FB67F7F3325"></a></p>

<h4>1.3 <span class="Heading">Groups which this package can deal with</span></h4>

<p>In principle this package permits to construct and investigate all groups which have faithful representations as residue-class-wise affine groups. Among many others, the following groups and their subgroups belong to this class:</p>


<ul>
<li><p>Finite groups, and certain divisible torsion groups which they embed into.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Free groups of finite rank.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Free products of finitely many finite groups, thus in particular the modular group PSL(2,ℤ).</p>

</li>
<li><p>Direct products of the above groups.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Wreath products of the above groups with finite groups and with (ℤ,+).</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>This list permits already to conclude that there are finitely generated residue-class-wise affine groups which do not have finite presentations, and such with algorithmically unsolvable membership problem. However the list is certainly by far not exhaustive, and using this package it is easy to construct groups of types which are not mentioned there.</p>

<p>The group CT(ℤ) which is generated by all <em>class transpositions</em> of ℤ -- these are involutions which interchange two disjoint residue classes, see <code class="func">ClassTransposition</code> (<a href="chap2.html#X8716A75F7DD1C46B"><span class="RefLink">2.2-3</span></a>) -- is a simple group which has subgroups of all types listed above. It is countable, but it has an uncountable series of simple subgroups which is parametrized by the sets of odd primes.</p>

<p>Proofs of most of the results mentioned here can be found in <a href="chapBib.html#biBKohl09">[Koh10]</a>. Descriptions of a part of the algorithms and methods which are implemented in this package can be found in <a href="chapBib.html#biBKohl08b">[Koh08a]</a>.</p>

<h4>1.4 <span class="Heading">Scope of this package</span></h4>

<p>This package can be applied in various ways to various different problems, and it is simply not possible to say what can be found out with its help about which groups. The best way to get an idea about this is likely to experiment with the examples discussed in this manual.</p>

<p>Of course this package often does not provide an out-of-the-box solution for a given problem. Quite often it is possible to find an answer for a given question by using an interactive trial-and-error approach.</p>

<p>With substantial help of this package, the author has found the results mentioned in Section <a href="chap1.html#X82190FB67F7F3325"><span class="RefLink">1.3</span></a>. Interactive sessions with this package have also lead to the development of most of the algorithms which are now implemented in it. Just to mention one example, developing the factorization method for residue-class-wise affine permutations (see <code class="func">FactorizationIntoCSCRCT</code> (<a href="chap2.html#X853885A182EC5104"><span class="RefLink">2.5-1</span></a>)) solely by means of theory would likely have been very hard.</p>
