  [1X1.1 Description[0X
  
  [5XHecke[0m is a port of the [5XGAP[0m 3-package [5XSpecht[0m 2.4 to [5XGAP[0m 4.
  
  This package contains functions for computing the decomposition matrices for
  Iwahori-Hecke   algebras   of   the   symmetric  groups.  As  the  (modular)
  representation  theory  of  these  algebras  closely  resembles  that of the
  (modular)  representation theory of the symmetric groups (indeed, the latter
  is  a  special  case of the former) many of the combinatorial tools from the
  representation theory of the symmetric group are included in the package.
  
  These  programs  grew  out of the attempts by Gordon James and Andrew Mathas
  [JM96]  to understand the decomposition matrices of Hecke algebras of type [13XA[0m
  when q=-1. The package is now much more general and its highlights include:
  
  (1)   [5XHecke[0m  provides a means of working in the Grothendieck ring of a Hecke
        algebra  H  using  the three natural bases corresponding to the Specht
        modules, projective indecomposable modules, and simple modules.
  
  (2)   For  Hecke  algebras  defined  over fields of characteristic zero, the
        algorithm  of  Lascoux,  Leclerc,  and  Thibon  [LLT96]  for computing
        decomposition  numbers  and  "crystallized decomposition matrices" has
        been  implemented.  In  principle, this gives all of the decomposition
        matrices of Hecke algebras defined over fields of characteristic zero.
  
  (3)   [5XHecke[0m provides a way of inducing and restricting modules. In addition,
        it  is  possible  to "induce" decomposition matrices; this function is
        quite  effective  in  calculating  the decomposition matrices of Hecke
        algebras for small n.
  
  (4)   The  q-analogue  of  Schaper's  theorem  [JM97]  is  included,  as  is
        Kleshchev's  [Kle96]  algorithm of calculating the Mullineux map. Both
        are used extensively when inducing decomposition matrices.
  
  (5)   [5XHecke[0m  can  be  used  to  compute the decomposition numbers of q-Schur
        algebras  (and  the  general  linear  groups),  although there is less
        direct  support for these algebras. The decomposition matrices for the
        q-Schur  algebras  defined over fields of characteristic zero for n<11
        and all e are included in [5XHecke[0m.
  
  (6)   The  Littlewood-Richard  rule,  its inverse, and functions for many of
        the  standard  operations  on  partitions  (such as calculating cores,
        quotients, and adding and removing hooks), are included.
  
  (7)   The  decomposition  matrices for the symmetric groups S_n are included
        for n<15 and for all primes.
  
  
  [1X1.2 The modular representation theory of Hecke algebras[0X
  
  The  "modular" representation theory of the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type [13XA[0m
  was  pioneered by Dipper and James [DJ86] [DJ87]; here the theory is briefly
  outlined, referring the reader to the references for details.
  
  Given a commutative integral domain R and a non-zero unit q in R, let H=H_R,
  q  be the Hecke algebra of the symmetric group S_n on n symbols defined over
  R and with parameter q. For each partition mu of n, Dipper and James defined
  a  [13XSpecht  module[0m  S(mu).  Let  rad~S(mu) be the radical of S(mu) and define
  D(mu)=S(mu)/rad~S(mu). When R is a field, D(mu) is either zero or absolutely
  irreducible. Henceforth, we will always assume that R is a field.
  
  Given  a non-negative integer i, let [i]_q=1+q+...+q^i-1. Define e to be the
  smallest  non-negative integer such that [e]_q=0; if no such integer exists,
  we  set  e  equal to 0. Many of the functions in this package depend upon e;
  the  integer  e  is the Hecke algebras analogue of the characteristic of the
  field in the modular representation theory of finite groups.
  
  A  partition  mu=(mu_1,mu_2,...)  is [13Xe-singular[0m if there exists an integer i
  such  that mu_i=mu_i+1=cdots= mu_i+e-1>0; otherwise, mu is [13Xe-regular[0m. Dipper
  and  James  [DJ86]  showed that D(nu)<> 0 if and only if nu is e-regular and
  that  the  D(nu) give a complete set of non-isomorphic irreducible H-modules
  as  nu  runs  over  the  e-regular partitions of n. Further, S(mu) and S(nu)
  belong  to  the  same  block  if  and only if mu and nu have the same e-core
  [DJ87][JM97]. Note that these results depend only on e and not directly on R
  or q.
  
  Given  two  partitions mu and nu, where nu is e -regular, let d_mu,nu be the
  composition  multiplicity  of D(nu) in S(nu). The matrix D=(d_mu,nu) is the [13X
  decomposition  matrix[0m  of  H. When the rows and columns are ordered in a way
  compatible with dominance, D is lower unitriangular.
  
  The  indecomposable H-modules P(nu) are indexed by e -regular partitions nu.
  By  general  arguments,  P(nu)  has  the  same composition factors as sum_mu
  d_mu,nu  S(mu); so these linear combinations of modules become identified in
  the  Grothendieck  ring  of H. Similarly, D(nu) = sum_mu d_nu,mu^-1 S(mu) in
  the  Grothendieck  ring.  These  observations  are the basis for many of the
  computations in [5XHecke[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.3 Two small examples[0X
  
  Because  of  the  algorithm  of  [LLT96], in principle, all of decomposition
  matrices  for  all Hecke algebras defined over fields of characteristic zero
  are known and available using [5XHecke[0m. The algorithm is recursive; however, it
  is quite quick and, as with a car, you need never look at the engine:
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4Xgap> H:=Specht(4);   # e=4, 'R' a field of characteristic 0[0X
    [4X<Hecke algebra with e = 4>[0X
    [4Xgap> RInducedModule(MakePIM(H,12,2));[0X

  The [LLT96] algorithm was applied 24 times during this calculation.
  
  For  Hecke algebras defined over fields of positive characteristic the major
  tool  provided  by [5XHecke[0m, apart from the decomposition matrices contained in
  the  libraries, is a way of "inducing" decomposition matrices. This makes it
  fairly  easy  to calculate the associated decomposition matrices for "small"
  n.  For  example, the [5XHecke[0m libraries contain the decomposition matrices for
  the  symmetric  groups  S_n  over fields of characteristic 3 for n<15. These
  matrices were calculated by [5XHecke[0m using the following commands:
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X

  The  function  [10XInducedDecompositionMatrix[0m  contains  almost  every trick for
  computing decomposition matrices (except using the spin groups).
  
  [5XHecke[0m can also be used to calculate the decomposition numbers of the q-Schur
  algebras;  although, as yet, here no additional routines for calculating the
  projective  indecomposables  indexed by e-singular partitions. Such routines
  may  be  included  in  a  future  release,  together  with the (conjectural)
  algorithm  [LT96]  for  computing  the decomposition matrices of the q-Schur
  algebras over fields of characteristic zero.
