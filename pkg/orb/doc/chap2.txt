  [33X[0;0YTo  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [11Xpkg[111X directory.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  default  the  [5Xorb[105X  package is not automatically loaded by [5XGAP[105X when it is
  installed.  You  must  load  the package with [10XLoadPackage("orb");[110X before its
  functions become available.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  of  version 3.0, the [5Xorb[105X package has a [5XGAP[105X kernel component which should
  be  compiled. This component does not actually contain new functionality but
  will  improve  the  performance  of  AVL trees and hash tables significantly
  since many core routines are implemented in the C language at kernel level.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo compile the C part of the package do (in the [11Xpkg[111X directory)[133X
  
      cd orb
      ./configure
      make
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you installed the package in another [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X directory than the standard [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X
  directory  in  your  [5XGAP[105X  4  installation,  then  you have to do two things.
  Firstly during compilation you have to use the option [10X--with-gaproot=PATH[110X of
  the [11Xconfigure[111X script where [21XPATH[121X is a path to the main [5XGAP[105X root directory (if
  not given the default [21X[11X../..[111X[121X is assumed).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSecondly  you  have to specify the path to the directory containing your [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X
  directory  to  [5XGAP[105X's  list  of directories. This can be done by starting [5XGAP[105X
  with  the [21X[11X-l[111X[121X command line option followed by the name of the directory and a
  semicolon.  Then  your  directory  is  prepended  to the list of directories
  searched.  Otherwise the package is not found by [5XGAP[105X. Of course, you can add
  this option to your [5XGAP[105X startup script.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  installed  [5XGAP[105X  on  several  architectures,  you  must  execute the
  configure/make  step  for  each of the architectures. You can either do this
  immediately after configuring and compiling [5XGAP[105X itself on this architecture,
  or  alternatively  (when  using  version  4.5  of  [5XGAP[105X  or  newer)  set  the
  environment  variable  [10XCONFIGNAME[110X  to the name of the configuration you used
  when  compiling  [5XGAP[105X  before  running  [10X./configure[110X.  Note  however that your
  compiler  choice  and flags (environment variables [10XCC[110X and [10XCFLAGS[110X) need to be
  chosen  to  match the setup of the original [5XGAP[105X compilation. For example you
  have to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode correctly![133X
  
  
  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YStatic linking[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  feature does not work in this version of the package. We leave the old
  documentation  here  for  the  case that the feature will be reenabled inthe
  future.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis might be interesting for M$ Windows users, as dynamic loading of binary
  modules  does  not  always  work there. You can also create a new statically
  linked [21X[11Xgap[111X[121X binary as follows:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YGo  into  the main [5XGAP[105X directory and then into [11Xbin/BINDIR[111X. Here [11XBINDIR[111X means
  the  directory  containing  the  [21X[11Xgap[111X[121X  executable  after  compiling [21X[11Xgap[111X[121X. This
  directory  also  contains  the  [5XGAP[105X compiler script [21X[11Xgac[111X[121X. Assuming [5Xorb[105X in the
  standard location you can then say[133X
  
      ./gac -o gap-static -p "-DORBSTATIC" -P "-static" ../../pkg/orb/src/orb.c
  
  [33X[0;0YThen  copy  your [21X[11Xgap[111X[121X start script to, say, [21X[11Xgaps[111X[121X and change the references to
  the [5XGAP[105X binary to [21X[11Xgap-static[111X[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  you  have  to  replace  [11XBINDIR[111X  by  the  name containing the [21X[11Xgap[111X[121X
  executable  after  compiling GAP as above. If you have installed the package
  in  a  different  place  than the standard, you have to replace [21X[11X../..[111X[121X in the
  above command by the path to the directory containing the [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X directory into
  which you installed [5Xorb[105X. If you want to install more than one package with a
  C-part  like  this  package,  you  can  still create a statically linked [5XGAP[105X
  executable  by  combining  all  the  compile and link options and all the .c
  files as in the ./gac command above. For the [5Xorb[105X package, you have to add[133X
  
      -DORBSTATIC
  
  [33X[0;0Yto the string of the -p option and the file[133X
  
    ../../pkg/orb/src/orb.c
  
  [33X[0;0Ysomewhere  on  the  command  line.  As  above,  [21X[11X../..[111X[121X  and [21X[11XBINDIR[111X[121X have to be
  replaced if you installed in a non-standard location.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YRecompiling the documentation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YRecompiling  the  documentation  is possible by the command [21X[11Xgap makedoc.g[111X[121X in
  the [11Xorb[111X directory. But this should not be necessary.[133X

  etc.  concerning this package. Also, I would like to hear about applications
  of this package.[133X
