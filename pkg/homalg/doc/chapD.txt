  Beside  the  [5XGAP[0m  builtin  debugging  facilities (--> [14X'Tutorial: Debugging'[0m)
  [5Xhomalg[0m provides two ways to debug the computations.
  
  
  [1XD.1 Increase the assertion level[0X
  
  [5Xhomalg[0m  comes  with numerous builtin assertion checks. They are activated if
  the user increases the assertion level using
  [10XSetAssertionLevel[0m( [3Xlevel[0m );
  (-->  [14X'Reference:  SetAssertionLevel'[0m),  where  [3Xlevel[0m  is  one of the values
  below:

        3     | "low"-level homological assertions are checked

  In  particular,  if [5Xhomalg[0m delegates matrix operations to an external system
  then  [10XSetAssertionLevel[0m(  4  ); can be used to let [5Xhomalg[0m debug the external
  system.
