  
  [1XF Overview of the [5Xhomalg[1X Package Source Code[0X
  
  The  [5Xhomalg[0m  package  reached more than 50.000 lines of [5XGAP4[0m code (excluding
  the documentation) before the first release was made. To keep this amount of
  code tracebale, the package was split in several files.
