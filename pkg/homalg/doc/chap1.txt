  [1X1.1 What is the role of the [5Xhomalg[1X package in the [5Xhomalg[1X project?[0X
  
  
  [1X1.1-1 Philosophy[0X
  
  The  package  [5Xhomalg[0m is meant to be the first part of a continuously growing
  open  source  multi  volume  book about homological and homotopical algebra.
  [5Xhomalg[0m  is  an  attempt  to  translate  as  much  as possible of homological
  algebra,  as  can  be  found  in books like [CE99], [ML63], [HS97], [Rot79],
  [Wei94],   and  [GM03],  into  a  language  that  a  computer  can  directly
  understand.  But  just  like  the  aforementioned books, [5Xhomalg[0m should, to a
  great  extent, be readable by a mathematician, even without deep programming
  knowledge.  For  the reasons mentioned in (--> Appendix [14XB.2[0m) [5XGAP4[0m was chosen
  as the language of [5Xhomalg[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.1-2 [5Xhomalg[1X provides ...[0X
  
  The  package  [5Xhomalg[0m  is  the  foundational part of the project. It provides
  procedures to construct basic objects in homological algebra:
  
  --    filtrations of objects
  
  --    complexes (of objects and of complexes)
  
  --    chain morphisms
  
  --    bicomplexes
  
  --    bigraded (differential) objects
  
  --    spectral sequences
  
  --    functors
  
  Beside  these  so-called  constructors [5Xhomalg[0m provides [13Xoperations[0m to perform
  computations with these objects. The list of operations includes:
  
  --    computation of subfactor objects
  
  --    applying   functors  (like  [10XExt[0m,  [10XTor[0m,  ...)  to  objects,  morphisms,
        complexes and chain morphisms
  
  --    derivation and composition of functors
  
  --    horse shoe resolution of short exact sequences of objects
  
  --    connecting homomorphisms and long exact sequences
  
  --    Cartan-Eilenberg resolution of complexes
  
  --    hyper (co)homology
  
  --    spectral sequences of bicomplexes
  
  --    the  Grothendieck  spectral  sequences  associated  to  two composable
        functors
  
  --    test if an object is torsion-free, reflexive, projective, stably free,
        pure
  
  --    determine   the   rank,   grade,   projective   dimension,  degree  of
        torsion-freeness, and codegree of purity of an object
  
  Using  the  philosophy  of  [5XGAP4[0m, one or more methods are [13Xinstalled[0m for each
  operation,  depending  on  [13Xproperties[0m and [13Xattributes[0m of these objects. These
  properties  and  attributes  can themselves be computed by methods installed
  for this purpose.
  
  
  [1X1.1-3 Building upon the [5Xhomalg[1X package[0X
  
  As  mentioned  above,  the  package  [5Xhomalg[0m  should  only  be  the first and
  foundational  part  of  the  [5Xhomalg[0m  project. On the one hand it is designed
  independently of the details of the different matrix operations, which other
  packages   are   meant   to   provide.   Typically,   these  packages  (like
  [5XRingsForHomalg[0m) heavily rely on existing, well tested, and optimized systems
  like  [5XSingular[0m, [5XMacaulay2[0m, or [5XMAGMA[0m. On the other hand other packages can be
  built upon or extend the [5Xhomalg[0m package in different ways:
  
  --    add constructors (sheaves, schemes, simplicial sets, ...)
  
  --    add  methods  for  basic  operation (Yoneda products, Massey products,
        Steenrod operations, ...)
  
  --    add  methods to compute sheaf cohomology, local cohomology, Hochschild
        (co)homology, cyclic (co)homology...
  
  --    provide  algorithms  for  holonomic D-modules based on the restriction
        algorithm:  localization, computing tensor products, [10XHom[0m, [10XExt[0m, de Rham
        cohomology, ...
  
  --    support  change  of  rings, Lyndon/Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence,
        base change spectral sequences, ...
  
  --    support  perturbation  techniques,  Serre and Eilenberg-Moore spectral
        sequence of simplicial spaces of infinite type, ...
  
  --    ...
  
  The  project  will  remain  open  and  contributions are highly welcome. The
  different packages will be attributed to their respective authors. The whole
  project  will  be  attributed  to  the  "[5Xhomalg[0m  team", i.e. the authors and
  contributers of all packages in the project.
  
  
  [1X1.2 This manual[0X
  
  Chapter [14X2[0m describes the installation of this package. The remaining chapters
  are  each  devoted  to  one  of  the  [5Xhomalg[0m  objects  (-->  [14X1.1-2[0m) with its
  constructors, properties, attributes, and operations.
